These are tall of stature. their clothes are all gray, and their hair black. they live in mounds and are also called "elves."There is an "elf howe" in northern Streymoy, south from Haldarsvik.They live like other folk, go out to fish, and have sheep and cattle, which go in the pastures among other cattle. They can make themselves and their property invisible to mortal men, and hence it is often said, when one is searching for anything, that a "hulda has hid it."They are eager to get children, who have not been baptised, taken out of the cradle, and to leave their own instead, but the latter remain mere idiots.Little children, who go out alone, often disappear, carried off by the huldu folk. Sometimes they are afterwards found far away from any habitation, and have then told that a big man brought them food while they were away.Huldu girls often fall in love with Christian men, and try then to tempt them, and draw them to themselves. if the men are out on the pastures, thirsty and tired, then the mound opens and the girl comes out to offer them ale or milk to drink. Unless they blow off the froth (for in that lies the charm), they forget everything as soon as they drink, the fairy gets power over them, and carries them off with her into her elf howe.
