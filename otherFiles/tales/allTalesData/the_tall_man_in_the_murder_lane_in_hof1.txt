From Enoch Widmann's Chronicle of Hof :In 1519, just before the plague killed so many people in Hof a large, tall black man was seen in Murder Lane. His wide spread legs reached both sides of the street, and his head rose far above the housetops.My great grandmother, Walburg Widmann, herself, saw how he walked along this street one evening with one foot at the tavern's entrance and the other foot across the street in front of the large house there. She was so frightened that she did know which way to go. In God's name and making the sign of the cross, she advanced in the middle of the street and passed between his legs. Had she not dared to do this the ghost would have followed her. She had barely escaped when the ghost clapped his legs together so hard that all the houses in Murder Lane nearly collapsed.Soon afterward the plague befell the city, and it was first felt in Murder Lane.
