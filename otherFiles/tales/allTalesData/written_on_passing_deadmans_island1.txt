In the Gulf of St Lawrence, Late in the Evening, Sept. 1804.See you, beneath yon cloud so dark,Fast gliding along, a gloomy bark?Her sails are full, though the wind is still,And there blows not a breath her sails to fill!Oh! what doth that vessel of darkness bear?The silent calm of the grave is there,Save now and again a death knell rung,And the flap of the sails, with night fog hung!There lieth a wreck on the dismal shoreOf cold and pitiless Labrador.Where, under the moon, upon mounts of frost,Full many a mariner's bones are tost!Yon shadowy bark hath been to that wreck,And the dim blue fire, that lights her deck,Doth play on as pale and livid a crew,As ever yet drank the church yard dew!To Dead Man's Isle, in the eye of the blast,To Dead Man's Isle, she speeds her fast.By skeleton shapes her sails are furl'd,And the hand that steers is not of this world!Oh! hurry thee on   oh! hurry thee on,Thou terrible bark! ere the night be gone,Nor let morning look on so foul a sightAs would blanch for ever her rosy light!*This is one of the Magdalen Islands, and, singularly enough, is the property of Sir Isaac Coffin. The above lines were suggested by a superstition very common among sailors, who call this ghost ship, I think, "The Flying Dutchman."
