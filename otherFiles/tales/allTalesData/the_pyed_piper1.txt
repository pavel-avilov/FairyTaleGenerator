At Hammel , a town in the Dutchy of Brunswick , in the year of Christ 1284, upon the 26. day of June , the Town being grievously troubled with Rats and Mice, there came to them a Piper, who promised upon a certain rate to free them from them all. it was agreed, he went from street to street, and playing upon his Pipe, drew after him out of the Town all that kind of Vermine, and then demanding his wages was denied it. Whereupon he began another tune, and there followed him one hundred thirty Boys to a Hill called Koppen , situate on the North by the Road, where they perished, and were never seen after. This Piper was called the pyed Piper, because his cloaths were of several colours.This story is writ and religiously kept by them in their Annals at Hammel , read in their Books, and painted in their Windows, and in their Churches, of which I am a Witness by my own sight. Their elder Magistrates, for the confirmation of the truth of this, are wont to write in conjunction in their publick Books, such a year of Christ, and such a year of the Transmigration of the children,  c. It's also observed in the memory of it, that in the street he passed out of, no Piper be admitted to this day. The street is called Burgelosestrasse . if a Bride be in that street, till she is gone out of it there is no dancing to be suffered.
