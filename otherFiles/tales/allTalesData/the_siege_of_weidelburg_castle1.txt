Reinhard von Dalwigk the Unborn, was a brave and proud knight. He lived like a small prince. His violence and eternal feuds, as well as the robbery and plundering that he was accused of, brought him the enmity of his prince, Count Ludwig the Peaceful, who then had his vassals besiege the knight in his Castle Weidelburg. After a long siege the knight finally recognized that there was no chance for a good outcome.Then his wife, the beautiful Agnes went down to the enemy camp and had herself brought before the landgrave. Crying, she fell to his feet and begged for mercy.The angry count insisted that the knight surrender, but he was touched by the woman's tears, and said that although he had at first intended to not even allow a dog to escape death in the castle, he would now permit her and her maidservants, each carrying what was dear to her, to go free. But the men would have to remain in the castle, awaiting further decisions. The count gave his noble pledge to honor this promise.She hurried back to the castle. Her maidservants loaded themselves with her best clothes and jewelry. She then took her husband onto her back, and thus they departed.When the count saw them, he stated that the knight's departure had not been a part of his promise.Agnes replied, "But what else would be of value to me, if I were leaving my husband behind in mortal danger? You promised that I could take my most precious belongings with me. therefore I choose my most valuable treasure."This loyalty and love broke the count's anger, and he let them go.
