Some people suggest that the Nephites can take forms other than human.It was just past midnight when a woman who was working a late shift found it necessary to walk home, as the last bus had already left. Often she had walked alone in the dark but this night she was frightened. As she approached the viaduct, a huge German police dog came toward her. She found the sight of the dog reassuring and wished it would walk home with her. When the dog was beside her, it turned and began trotting in the direction she was going. While they walked on the viaduct a car drove up, stopped beside her, and a man leaped out. The dog, which was walking a little ahead of the woman, turned and dashed toward the man, who jumped back into the car and drove away. When the woman reached her home, she called to her protector to come close so she could pet it, but it stood quietly a short distance away looking at her. She called through the door to her mother to come and see the beautiful creature, but as her mother opened the door, the dog vanished. She believed that a Nephite had taken the form of a dog to protect her.Manuscript version in Archives of the Utah Humanities Research Foundation.Written by Miss Monza Higgs.
