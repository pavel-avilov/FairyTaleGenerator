In the vicinity of Storkow a preacher was driving home late one evening with his servant. Arriving at a certain place they saw a will o' the wisp approaching them. It hopped about merrily in front of the horses. Soon there were more of them, and finally there were so many of them that the horses took fright and would not continue onward.The pastor became frightend as well, and therefore he began to pray aloud, but the more he prayed, the more of them came.Finally the servant said, "No. Stop that. You're not making them go away. I'll get rid of them!"With that he shouted, "Go away, in the devil's name!" and they immediately disappeared.
