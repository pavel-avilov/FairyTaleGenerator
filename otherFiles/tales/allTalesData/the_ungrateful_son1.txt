The old man, it seemed, always visited his son just at mealtime."You needn't fix anything for me," he would say, looking hungrily on as the others prepared to eat.Of course they had to give him something."This has to stop," said the old man's son on a day when they had killed a chicken for a special feast. "If the old man comes today, we will hide the pot."As expected, the old man knocked at the door just before mealtime. Hurriedly they hid the pot with the chicken, then acted as if they knew nothing of a forthcoming meal. The old man sniffed in the air, said something about the good smell, looked about, then seeing nothing to eat, he took leave and returned to his own house."Now we can eat!" said the man, bringing the pot from its hiding place and taking off the lid.But to his terror, the chicken turned into a hideous toad before his very eyes. It jumped into his face, attaching itself firmly, and it did not come off as long as the man lived.
