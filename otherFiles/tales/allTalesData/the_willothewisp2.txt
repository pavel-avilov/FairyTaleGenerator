The will o' the wisp is a mischievous gnome who leads people astray at nighttime or in the fog, causing them to loose their way and end up in a swamp. He does this foremost with inquisitive people who purposely follow him. The best way to avoid him or to render him harmless is to stay away from the footpaths where he has power, and always to keep one foot in a wagon rut. He helps some people who have lost their way by leading them home, if they speak to him kindly and offer him a generous payment.Once a person who had lost his way offered him two silver groschens if he would lead him home safely. The will o' the wisp agreed, and finally they arrived at the lost man's house. Happy that he was no longer in need of help, he thanked his guide. but instead of the promised payment, he gave him only a small copper coin. The will o' the wisp accepted it, then asked if he could now find his way home by himself.He answered, "Yes! I can already see my open front door." But stepping toward it, he fell into some water, for everything he had seen had been only an illusion.The will o' the wisp takes special delight in tormenting drunks making their way homeward from a fair or an evening of drinking. He leads them astray, and when in their drunkenness they can go no further, preferring instead to sleep off their binge out of doors, then he burns them on the soles of their feet.In some regions the people believe that will o' the wisps are the souls of children who died without being baptized. They are seen especially atop graveyard walls. They disappear when one throws a handful of graveyard soil at them.
