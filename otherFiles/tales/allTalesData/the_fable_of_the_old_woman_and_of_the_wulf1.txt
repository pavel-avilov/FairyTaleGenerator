Men ought not byleve on al maner sprytes / As reherceth this fable of an old woman / which said to her child bicause that it wept / certeynly if thow wepst ony more / I shal make the to be ete of the wulf /   the wulf herying this old woman / abode styll to fore the yate /   supposed to have eten the old womans child /   by cause that the wulf had soo longe taryed there that he was hongry / he retorned and went ageyne in to the wood / And the shewulf demaunded of mym / why hast thow not brought to me some mete / And the wulf ansuerd / by cause / that the old woman hath begyled me / the whiche had promysed to me to gyve to me her child for to have ete hym / And at the laste I hadd hit not / And therfore men ought in no wyse to trust the woman / And he is wel a fole that setteth his hope and truste in a woman / And therfore truste them not / and thow shalt doo as the sage and wyse.Retold in modern English:One should not believe everything that one hears, as evidenced by this fable about the old woman who said to her crying child: "If you don't stop crying, I'll throw you to the wolf, and he'll eat you up!"Hearing this, the wolf stayed by the gate and hoped to eat the woman's child, but he only grew more and more hungry. Finally he gave up and returned to his den in the woods. The she wolf berated him for not bringing home any meat.The wolf answered her: "It is because the old woman deceived me. She promised to give me her child to eat, but she never did so. Thus men should never trust a woman."It is only a fool who puts his hope and trust in a woman. Be wise and never trust them.
