The Tappan Sea ... was said to be haunted. Often in the still twilight of a summer evening, when the sea would be as glass, and the opposite hills would throw their purple shadows half across it, a low sound would be heard as of the steady, vigorous pull of oars, though not a boat was to be descried.Some might have supposed that a boat was rowed along unseen under the deep shadows of the opposite shores. but the ancient traditionists of the neighborhood knew better. Some said it was one of the whale boats of the old Water Guard, sunk by the British ships during the war, but now permitted to haunt its old cruising grounds. but the prevalent opinion connected it with the awful fate of Rambout van Dam of graceless memory.He was a roistering Dutchman of Spiting Devil, who in times long past had navigated his boat alone one Saturday the whole length of the Tappan Sea, to attend a quilting frolic at Kakiat, on the western shore. Here he had danced and drunk until midnight, when he entered his boat to return home. He was warned that he was on the verge of Sunday morning. but he pulled off nevertheless, swearing he would not land until he reached Spiting Devil, if it took him a month of Sundays.He was never seen afterwards. but may be heard plying his oars, as above mentioned,   being the Flying Dutchman of the Tappan Sea, doomed to ply between Kakiat and Spiting Devil until the day of judgment.
