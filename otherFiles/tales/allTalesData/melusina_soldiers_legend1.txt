Once at midnight Melusina approached a sentry beneath the Castle Gate Bridge. She asked him to redeem her. For this to succeed, the following midnight she would appear to him in the form of a serpent with a key in her mouth. He was to take the key into his mouth and then lay it on the altar of the Dominican Church. Then she would become his bride, and all her treasures would belong to him.When she thus appeared to him, the soldier turned ice cold, and he was overcome with shuddering.The following day the death bell tolled down from the old cathedral, and in the cemetery a grave was dug for the young warrior.
