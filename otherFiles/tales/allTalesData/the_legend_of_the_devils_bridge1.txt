Straddling the Serchio river by the small town of Borgo a Mozzano in northern Tuscany, the striking Ponte della Maddalena, also known as the Devil's Bridge, is shrouded in mystery and, for this reason, is a source of fascination for many visitors who travel to the area just to see it.According to legend, the head construction worker supervising the building of the bridge was worried about not completing the work on time. Thus, he made a pact with the devil: in exchange for his help to finish the bridge in one night, the devil demanded the soul of the first passerby to cross the bridge. However, feeling remorseful about giving a person's soul to the devil, the construction worked consulted with the local priest and they decided to have a dog cross the bridge first. Furious, the devil plunged into the river with the dog, never to be seen again.It is said that the dog, a white Maremma sheepdog, is sometimes seen walking on the bridge in the evenings at the end of October, and that he is the devil still looking for the soul of the head construction worker.Probably commissioned by the Countess Matilda of Tuscany in the 11th century, the Ponte della Maddalena, a remarkable example of medieval engineering, used to be on the Via Francigena, one of the most important pilgrimage routes in the Middle Ages.It took on the name of Ponte della Maddalena around 1500, because a statue of Mary Magdalene stood at the foot of the bridge in an oratory (now the statue is in the parish church of Borgo a Mozzano).
