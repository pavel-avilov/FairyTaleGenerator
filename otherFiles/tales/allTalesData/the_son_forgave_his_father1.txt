In olden times it was the custom in a certain town that when the master of the house became old his son had to take him away and drown him.A young man's father became old, and he said to his father, "come with me. The time has come for you to be drowned."The poor old man followed along and the son led him to a hill.He was about to push him into the water when the old man said to him, "Son, don't drown me at this place, for this is where I drowned my father."Hearing this, the young man thought, "He drowned his father just as I am about to drown him, and in the same manner my son will drown me."Thus he forgave his father and did not drown him. The entire town heard what had happened to the old man and swore never again to drown their old men.
