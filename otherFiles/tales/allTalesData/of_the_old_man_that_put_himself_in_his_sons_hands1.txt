There was a certain old man, which let his son to marry, and to bring his wife and his children, to dwell with him, and to take all the house into his own hand and bidding.So a certain time the old man was set and kept the upper end of the table, afterward they set him lower, about the middle of the table, thirdly they set him at the nether end of the table, fourthly he was set among the servants, fifthly they made him a couch behind the hall door, and cast on him an old sackcloth.Not long after the old man died, when he was dead, the young man's son came to him and said, "Father I pray you, give me this old sackcloth, that was wont to cover my grandfather.""What wouldst thou do with it?" said his father?"Forsooth," said the child, "it shall serve to cover you when you be old, like as it did my grandfather."At which words of the child this man ought to have been ashamed and sorry.For it is written: Son, reverence and help thy father in his old age, and make him not thoughtful and heavy in his life, and though he dote forgive it him.He that honoreth his father, shall live the longer, and shall rejoice in his own children.
