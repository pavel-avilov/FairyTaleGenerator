The fox was once going over a loch, and there met him a little bonnach, and the fox asked him where he was going. The little bonnach told him he was going to such a place."And whence camest thou?" said the fox."I came from Geeogan, and I came from Cooaigean, and I came from the slab of the bonnach stone, and I came from the eye of the quern, and I will come from thee if I may," quoth the little bonnach."Well, I myself will take thee over on my back," said the fox."Thou'lt eat me, thou'lt eat me," quoth the little honnach."Come then on the tip of my tail," said the fox."Oh! I will not. thou wilt eat me," said the little bonnach."Come into my ear," said the fox."I will not go. thou wilt eat me," said the little bonnach."Come into my mouth," said the fox."Thou wilt eat me that time at all events," said the little bonnach."Oh, I will not eat thee," said the fox. "At the time when I am swimming I cannot eat anything at all."He went into his mouth."Oh! ho!" said the fox, "I may do my own pleasure to thee now. It is long since it was heard that a hard morsel is good in the mouth of the stomach."The fox ate the little bonnach. Then he went to the house of a gentleman, and he went to a loch, and he caught hold of a duck that was in if, and he ate that.He went up to a hill side, and he began to stroke his sides on the hill."Oh king! how finely the bullet would spank upon my belly just now."Who was listening but a hunter."It will be tried upon thee directly," said the hunter."Bad luck to the place that is here," quoth the fox, "in which a creature dares not say a word in fun that is not taken in earnest."The hunter put a bullet in his gun, and he fired at him and killed him.
