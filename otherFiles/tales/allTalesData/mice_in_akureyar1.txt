Those who wish to injure their enemies send against them either the spirits called sendingar or animals known as stefnivargar. The word stefni varg literally means a wolf ( varg ) that is directed ( stefna ) against something, but in this connection is used of animals which have power given to them by magic, and are then sent to do harm.There was once a rich man in Akureyar, who was a thorough miser, and would never give anything to the poor. To punish him for this, a certain wizard sent him so many "mice wolves," that they destroyed all he had, and he finally died in the greatest poverty.For a long time after this the mice remained in the island, until the then owner sent for another wizard. He came, and got a whole leg of mutton roasted. then he sat down on the island, and began to eat this. In a moment the mice surrounded him in crowds to get a bit of it. The. wizard rose again, and with the leg of mutton in his hand, went back to the farm, and all through it, until he had gathered round him every mouse on the island.Then he threw the mutton into a deep pit, which he had got dug for the purpose. The mice all sprang into the pit, which was then closed up at once, and the wizard strictly forbade anyone to touch it in time coming.For a long time after this there were no mice in Akureyar, but many years later the proprietor of the islands had a foundation dug for some new building, and they were careless enough to open the pit again. In a moment the mice crowded out again, and have ever since been a plague to the islands, which otherwise are so excellent.
