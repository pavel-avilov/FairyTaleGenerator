1001 NightsThree men once went out in quest of riches and came upon a block of gold, weighing a hundred pounds. When they saw it, they took it up on their shoulders and fared on with it, till they drew near a certain city, when one of them said, "Let us sit in the mosque, whilst one of us goes and buys us what we may eat."So they sat down in the mosque and one of them arose and entered the city. When he came therein, his soul prompted him to play his fellows false and get the gold for himself alone. So he bought food and poisoned it. but, when he returned to his comrades, they fell upon him and slew him, so they might enjoy the gold without him. Then they ate of the (poisoned) food and died, and the gold abode cast down over against them.Presently, Jesus, son of Mary (on whom be peace!), passed by and seeing this, besought God the Most High for tidings of their case. so He told him what had betided them, whereat great was his wonderment and he related to his disciples what he had seen.
