In addition to the gods, heathens knew a whole row of lower demons which can be placed together under the names sprites and elves. They constitute a distinct spirit realm on earth, independent of the world of humans. They possess supernatural powers with which they harm and help humans. However, they shy away from humans, because physically they are not our equals. In Bohemia they tell about the origin of these demons as follows:When God cast out the arrogant angels from heaven, they became the evilspirits that plague mankind day and night, tormenting us and inflicting us with harm.The ones who fell into hell and into caves and abysses became devils anddeath maidens. However, those who fell onto the earth became goblins,imps, dwarfs, thumblings, alps, noon and evening ghosts, andwill o' the wisps. Those who fell into the forests became the wood spiritswho live there: the hey men, the wild men, the forest men, the wild women,and the forest women. Finally, those who fell into the water became waterspirits: water men, mermaids, and merwomen.
