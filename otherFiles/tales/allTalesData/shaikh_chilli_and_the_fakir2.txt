One day Shaikh Chilli was very sick and he vowed that if he got well he would feed a fakir.When he recovered he went out and meeting a fakir he said: "Will you kindly eat at my house today?"The fakir agreed and when the Shaikh asked him what he would eat, he said he would like an ounce of mung pulse.Shaikh Chilli went back to his wife and said: "A fakir will eat here today. Cook an ounce of mung pulse and you can give it to him. I perhaps shall not be home as I am going to the mosque to pray."She cooked the food and gave it to the fakir and then she asked: "Do you ever go to Khuda? If so perhaps you can tell me how my parents are getting on.""I go every day to Khuda," he replied, "and see your parents. They are miserable and get only bones to chow. but the parents of your husband get plenty of pulao. "So she gave him five hundred rupees and said: "Please take this money to my parents and let them get better food in future."When the Shaikh came back his wife said: "It is very hard that my parents should have to chew bones while yours get plenty of pulao. "When the Shaikh heard this he got on his horse and pursued the fakir. When the fakir saw him he climbed up a tree.The Shaikh climbed after him: and shouted: "Where is my money, you rascal?"The fakir went out along the branch and the Shaikh followed him. When he came over the place where the horse was tied the fakir jumped on it and rode away.When he came back his wife said: "Where is the horse?""When I heard," said he "that my parents had such high rank in heaven, I thought it only proper that they should have a horse to ride there. So I sent them mine."(Told by Muhammad Halim and recorded by M. Ram Sahay of Lucknow.)
