In about 1640 two citizens of Brussels who lived in the Rue des Tanneurs saw a grey, old man in the Sonian Forest. His clothing was in terrible condition, and of an ancient style. They invited him to go into a tavern with them, and he did so. However, he did not sit down, but rather drank while standing on his feet.When they were about to leave, he had much to say to them, mostly about things that had happened many centuries earlier. From this the two citizens realized that their companion was Isaac Laquedem, the Jew who had sent our Lord away from his door, and they departed from him in great fear.
