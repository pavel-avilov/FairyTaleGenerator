The parish (of Kemnay) is believed by some to derive its name from the Kembs , a chain of low rounded sand hills, which run along the northern boundary at some distance from the Don, and terminate on the borders of Cluny, on the southeast.A wild legend accounts for the peculiar broken character of these hills or rather hillocks , but it is almost forgotten in the parish, so that it is well nigh impossible to get a correct version of it. It appears, however, that the devil challenged an old witch to make a rope of sand. How she contrived to outwit his Satanic Majesty is unknown, but win the wager she did. The devil's rope broke, and remains to this day in the Kembs of Kemnay.
