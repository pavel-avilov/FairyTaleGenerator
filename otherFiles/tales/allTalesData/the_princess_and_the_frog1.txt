Once upon a time there lived a king and his daughter. She was about twenty years of age. One day as she was playing (with) a golden ball. There was a pond of water outside the palace. As she was playing, the ball fell into the pond, and she began to cry.Then a frog came up and asked why she was crying.She said her ball fell into the pond."If you give me three wishes I will bring it up to you," said the frog. When she got the ball she ran away, but the frog was calling her.The next day the frog came to the door, and the servant opened it."Is the king's youngest daughter inside?" said the frog.When the daughter came out she closed the door, and the king asked her where did she see the frog?She said she was playing (with) a ball, and it fell into the pond, and the frog brought it up.The king said that she would have to drink from the one cup, and to eat from the one plate, and she would have to go to bed with the frog.She did not like that. She went to bed, but she did not like to bring the frog, but she had to do so. She threw the frog on the floor, but she was not sleeping. So she got up, and she threw the frog into the bed. The frog began to tickle her toes, and the next morning who was in it but a fine young man.
