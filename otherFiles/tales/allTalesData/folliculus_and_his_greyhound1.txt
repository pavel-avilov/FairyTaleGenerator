Gesta RomanorumFolliculus, a knight, was fond of hunting and tournaments. He had anonly son, for whom three nurses were provided. Next to this child he lovedhis falcon and his greyhound.It happened one day that he was called to a tournament, whither hiswife and domestics went also, leaving the child in the cradle, thegreyhound lying by him, and the falcon on his perch.A serpent that inhabited a hole near the castle, taking advantage ofthe profound silence that reigned, crept from his habitation and advancedtowards the cradle to devour the child. The falcon, perceiving the danger,fluttered with his wings till he awoke the dog, who instantly attacked theinvader, and after a fierce conflict, in which he was sorely wounded,killed him. He then lay down on the ground to lick and heal hiswounds.When the nurses returned they found the cradle overturned, the childthrown out, and the ground covered with blood, as well as the dog, who,they immediately concluded, had killed the child. Terrified at the idea ofmeeting the anger of the parents, they determined to escape, but in theirflight fell in with their mistress, to whom they were compelled to relatethe supposed murder of the child by the greyhound.The knight soon arrived to hear the sad story, and, maddened with fury,rushed forward to the spot. The poor wounded and faithful animal made aneffort to rise, and welcome his master with his accustomed fondness. butthe enraged knight received him on the point of his sword, and he felllifeless to the ground.On examination of the cradle the infant was found alive and unhurt, andthe dead serpent lying by him. the knight now perceived what had happened,lamented bitterly over his faithful dog, and blamed himself for havingdepended too hastily on the words of his wife. Abandoning the professionof arms, he broke his lance in three pieces, and vowed a pilgrimage to theHoly Land, where he spent the rest of his days in peace.
