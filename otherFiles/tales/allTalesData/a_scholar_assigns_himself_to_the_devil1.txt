There was once a scholar in the school of Herlufsholm, who through the devil's craft was seduced to give himself up to his power and will. He therefore wrote a contract on a strip of paper with his own blood, and stuck it in a hole in the church wall. But for the salvation of his sinful soul, which the fiend would else have seized, it happened that another scholar of the school found the paper and took it to the rector.Now nothing was to be done but to have recourse to many prayers, whereby the devil's cunning was turned to naught. but it was long impossible to close up the hole in the wall so effectually that it was not immediately found open again.
