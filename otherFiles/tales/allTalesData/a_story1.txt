Once upon a time there were three men round on a holiday through the world. While they were on the journey they never went to mass. One of them was an Irishman, the other a Scotchman, and the other an Englishman.When the three men died they went to Hell. They met the devil. They asked the devil to let them out, but he would not. They kept asking him day after day to let them out, but he would not.He thought of a plan. He asked the three men to think of a question and within three days to have the question thought of and not to tell each of them what they were thinking of.The day came at last when they wer to be called out. The Englishman was the first to be called out. He said to the devil. "We have some cattle grazing out in a field. We have a certain name on one cow. Could you tell it to me?"The devil took his magic fan and said some words, and he brought the cow up beside him, so he was able to know the name. He wasn't going to get out.It was the Scotchman's turn now. He said to the devil. "We have a big brewery out in the world and we have a name on a certain name on a bottle of whiskey. Could you tell me that name?"The devil got his magic fan again, and he brought the bottle there beside them. He wasn't going to get out either.It was the Irishman's turn now, so he whistled a tune. When it was finished, he said, "Sew a button on that now."The devil was not able to do that. So he had to let the three of them out.Information received from:Written by:Mr. James HarteMaura MeehanKilcoon,Kilcoon,Dromahair,Dromahair,(age 40 years)(age 12 years)
