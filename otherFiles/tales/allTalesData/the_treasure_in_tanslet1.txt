There was a man from Als who found a treasure in a strange manner. One night he dreamed that he would find a treasure on a street in Flensburg. Relying on this, he went there. He walked about in the streets of Flensburg, but could not comprehend how he might find a treasure there.A Flensburger came to him and asked why he was walking about like that.He told the man about his dream, but the Flensburger laughed at him, saying, "In that case I should go to Tanslet on the island of Als, for last night I dreamed that a treasure was buried there."To this the man said nothing, but immediately returned to Als, and in Tanslet he found the treasure that he had intended to find on a street in Flensburg.
