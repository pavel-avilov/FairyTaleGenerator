There was a man at some time or other who was well off, and had many children. When the family grew up the man gave a well stocked farm to each of his children. When the man was old his wife died, and he divided all that he had amongst his children, and lived with them, turn about, in their houses. The sons and daughters got tired of him and ungrateful, and tried to get rid of him when he came to stay with them.At last an old friend found him sitting tearful by the wayside, and learning the cause of his distress, took him home. there he gave him a bowl of gold and a lesson which the old man learned and acted.When all the ungrateful sons and daughters had gone to a preaching, the old man went to a green knoll where his grandchildren were at play, and pretending to hide, he turned up a flat hearthstone in an old stance (standing place), and went out of sight.He spread out his gold on a big stone in the sunlight, and he muttered, "Ye are mouldy, ye are hoary, ye will be better for the sun."The grandchildren came sneaking over the knoll, and when they had seen and heard all that they were in tended to see and hear, they came running up with, "Grandfather, what have you got there?""That which concerns you not. touch it not," said the grandfather. and he swept his gold into a bag and took it home to his old friend.The grandchildren told what they had seen, and henceforth the children strove who should be kindest to the old grandfather.Still acting on the counsel of his sagacious old chum, he got a stout little black chest made, and carried it always with him.When any one questioned him as to its contents, his answer was, "That will be known when the chest is opened."When he died he was buried with great honour and ceremony, and then the chest was opened by the expectant heirs. In it were found broken potsherds and bits of slate, and a long handled, white wooden mallet with this legend on its head:So am favioche fiorum,Thabhavit gnoc annsa cheann,Do n'f hear nach gleidh maoin da' fein,Ach bheir a chuid go leir d'a chlann.Here is the fair mallTo give a knock on the skullTo the man who keeps no gear for himself,But gives all to his bairns.
