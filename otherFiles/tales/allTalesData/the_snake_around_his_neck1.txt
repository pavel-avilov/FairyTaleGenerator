Once there was a mother who gave all her property to her son, thinking that he was pious and good and would therefor treat her fairly. No! We should not give everything away before we die.After the son had taken possession of everything he got married, and his poor mother had to fend for herself.One day he was seated at the table with his wife. Before them they had a roasted chicken. The mother knocked on the door.He quickly called to his servant, "Hide the chicken in the chest until the old woman has left."The servant did just that. The hungry old mother came in. When she asked for a scrap of bread he sent her on her away with curse words.When she was gone he said to his servant, "Now go and bring the chicken back here."The servant went to the chest, but instead of a chicken lying on the plate there was a large snake. You can well imagine how the frightened servant cried out loud.The son did not want to believe that anything was wrong, so he sent the maid to the chest, but she too cried out and ran away.Then he became angry and said, "If the devil himself is on that plate, I shall fetch him."He went to the chest, opened it, and the snake jumped out and wrapped itself around his neck.From that time onward it ate with him and drank with him. And if the son refused to give it food, or if he attempted to take it off his neck, the snake pressed against him until he thought he would suffocate. He had to manage with the snake around his neck wherever he went, and all because he had treated his mother so badly.
