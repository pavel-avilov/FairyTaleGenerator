A violent death was deemed so pleasing to the gods, that it was not sought for in the field of battle only. "to gash oneself to Odin with the sword" was deemed better than to die of sickness or of old age.Those who were advanced in years precipitated themselves from lofty cliffs, which thence received the appellation of kith rocks, and so "fared to Valhalla."Three such cliffs in West Gothland and Bleking still bear the latter name, and to another the remarkable statement attaches, that the people, after dances and sports, threw themselves headlong from its top into the lake, as the ancients relate of the Hyperboreans and Scythians. (Plin. Hist. Nat. iv. 12)Domestic legends even inform us, that if a man became bedridden and frail with age, his kinsmen would assemble and put him to death with a club, called a kith club.
