In the old days, when men were allowed to have many wives, a middle aged man had one wife that was old and one that was young. each loved him very much, and desired to see him like herself.Now the man's hair was turninggrey, which the young wife did not like, as it made him look too old forher husband. So every night she used to comb his hair and pull out thewhite ones. But the elder wife saw her husband growing grey with greatpleasure, for she did not like to be mistaken for his mother. So everymorning she used to arrange his hair and pull out as many of the blackones as she could. In consequence the man soon found himself entirelybald.Yield to all and you will soon have nothing to yield.
