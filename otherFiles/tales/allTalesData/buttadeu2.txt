It was in winter, and my good father was at Sacalone, in the warehouse,warming himself at the fire, when he saw a man enter, dressed differentlyfrom the people of that region, with breeches striped in yellow, red, andblack, and his cap the same way. My good father was frightened. "Oh!" hesaid, "what is this person?""Do not be afraid," the man said. "I am called Buttadeu.""Oh!" said my father, "I have heard you mentioned. Be pleased to sitdown a while a tell me something.""I cannot sit, for I am condemned by my God always to walk." And whilehe was speaking he was always walking up and down and had no rest. Then hesaid: "Listen. I am going away. I leave you, in memory of me, this, thatyou must say a credo at the right hand of our Lord, and five othercredos at his left, and a salve regina to the Virgin, forthe grief I suffer on account of her son. I salute you.""Farewell.""Farewell, my name is Buttadeu."
