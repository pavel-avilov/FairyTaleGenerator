A woman in Kortrijk was a free spirited person, but never sacrilegious, like so many people are. On the other hand, her husband was a wild type who mocked everything and everyone.One Saturday the woman was late in returning home, and her husband thought that he would play a trick on her and frighten her. To do so he wrapped himself in a white cloth and waited at the crucifix in the graveyard where his wife would have to pass by.After ten o'clock his wife came by, accompanied by a neighbor woman. The man stood up in his white cloth and remained there standing still."Just look," said the neighbor. "There's a spirit.""Let him be," said the wife. "We'll say the Lord's Prayer for him.""For God's sake," said the neighbor after they had walked on a few steps. "Now there's another one. Now I can see two of them!"The wife did not answer, but she prayed.The man heard what the neighbor woman had said, and a shudder went through his whole body. Nonetheless, he wanted to convince himself before he took flight. Turning his head a little he saw a skeleton wrapped in a shroud standing next to him. Then he lost all courage and took off running after the women as fast as he could.The frightened women ran ahead and locked themselves inside the house."Wife, open the door!" cried the husband. "It's me!"But the wife did not open the door. Overcome by fear and dread, he fell down unconscious, and did not awaken until the next morning.
