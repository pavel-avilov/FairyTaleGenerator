A clergyman, it is said, was journeying one night to Roeskilde ( sic ) in Zealand. His way led by a hill in which there was music and dancing and great merriment going forward. Some dwarfs jumped suddenly out of it, stopped the carriage, and asked him whither he was going. He replied to the synod of the church. They asked him if he thought they could be saved. To that, he replied, he could not give an immediate answer. They then begged that he would give them a reply by next year.When he next passed, and they made the same demand, he replied, "No, you are all damned."Scarcely had he spoken the word, when the whole hill appeared in flames.
