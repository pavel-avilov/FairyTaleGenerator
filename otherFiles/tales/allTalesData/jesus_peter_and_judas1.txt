Toledot YeshuOn the journey from Rome to Jerusalem, Jesus, Peter, and Judas stopped at a small inn, and the host had only one goose to offer his three guests.Jesus then took the goose and said, "This is verily not sufficient for three persons. let us go to sleep, and the whole goose shall be his who shall have the best dream."Whereupon they lay down to slumber. In the middle of the night Judas arose and ate the goose.When morning came, the three met, and Peter said, "I dreamed I sat at the foot of the throne of Almighty God."And to him Jesus answered, "I am the son of Almighty God, and I dreamed thou wert seated near me. my dream is therefore superior to thine, and the goose shall be mine to eat."Then Judas said, "And I, while I was dreaming, ate the goose."And Jesus sought the goose, but vainly, for Judas had devoured it.
