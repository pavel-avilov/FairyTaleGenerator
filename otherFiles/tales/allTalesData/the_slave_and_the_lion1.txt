A slave ran away from his master, by whom he had been most cruellytreated, and, in order to avoid capture, betook himself into the desert.As he wandered about in search of food and shelter, he came to a cave,which he entered and found to by unoccupied. Really, however, it was alion's den, and almost immediately, to the horror of the wretchedfugitive, the lion himself appeared. The man gave himself up for lost.But, to his utter astonishment, the lion, instead of springing upon him,came and fawned upon him, at the same time whining and lifting up his paw.Observing it to be much swollen and inflamed, he examined it and found alarge thorn embedded in the ball of the foot. He accordingly removed itand dressed the wound as well as he could. And in course of time it healedup completely.The lion's gratitude was unbounded. He looked upon the man as hisfriend, and they shared the cave for some time together. A day came,however, when the slave began to long for the society of his follow men,and he bade farewell to the lion and returned to the town. Here he waspresently recognized and carried off in chains to his former master, whoresolved to make an example of him, and ordered that he should be thrownto the beasts at the next public spectacle in the theater.On the fatal day the beasts were loosed into the arena, and among therest a lion of huge bulk and ferocious aspect. And then the wretched slavewas cast in among them. What was the amazement of the spectators, when thelion after one glance bounded up to him and lay down at his feet withevery expression of affection and delight! It was his old friend of thecave! The audience clamored that the slave's life should be spared. Andthe governor of the town, marveling at such gratitude and fidelity in abeast, decreed that both should receive their liberty.
