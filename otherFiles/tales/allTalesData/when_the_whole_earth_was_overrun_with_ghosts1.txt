Some say that ever 'gainst that season comesWherein our Savior's birth is celebrated,The bird of dawning singeth all night long:And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad.The nights are wholesome. then no planets strike,No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,So hallowed and so gracious is the time. Marcellus.So have I heard and do in part believe it. Horatio.So says the immortal Shakespeare ( Hamlet , act 1, scene 1). andthe truth thereof few nowadays, I hope, will call in question. Groseobserves, too, that those born on Christmas Day cannot see spirits. whichis another incontrovertible fact.What a happiness this must have been seventy or eighty years ago andupwards, to those chosen few who had the good luck to be born on the eveof this festival of all festivals. when the whole earth was so overrunwith ghosts, boggles, bloody bones, spirits, demons, ignis fatui,brownies, bugbears, black dogs, specters, shellycoats, scarecrows,witches, wizards, barguests, Robin Goodfellows, hags, night bats, scrags,breaknecks, fantasms, hobgoblins, hobhoulards, boggy boes, dobbies,hob thrusts, fetches, kelpies, warlocks, mock beggars, mum pokers,Jemmy burties, urchins, satyrs, pans, fauns, sirens, tritons, centaurs,calcars, nymphs, imps, incubuses, spoorns, men in the oak, hell wains,fire drakes, kit a can sticks, Tom tumblers, melch dicks, larrs,kitty witches, hobby lanthorns, Dick a Tuesdays, Elf fires,Gyl burnt tales, knockers, elves, rawheads, Meg with the wads, old shocks,ouphs, pad foots, pixies, pictrees, giants, dwarfs, Tom pokers, tutgots,snapdragons, sprets, spunks, conjurers, thurses, spurns, tantarrabobs,swaithes, tints, tod lowries, Jack in the Wads, mormos, changelings,redcaps, yeth hounds, colt pixies, Tom thumbs, black bugs, boggarts,scar bugs, shag foals, hodge pochers, hob thrushes, bugs, bull beggars,bygorns, bolls, caddies, bomen, brags, wraiths, waffs, flay boggarts,fiends, gallytrots, imps, gytrashes, patches, hob and lanthorns, gringes,boguests, bonelesses, Peg powlers, pucks, fays, kidnappers, gallybeggars,hudskins, nickers, madcaps, trolls, robinets, friars' lanthorns, silkies,cauld lads, death hearses, goblins, hob headlesses, bugaboos, kows, orcowes, nickies, nacks (necks), waiths, miffies, buckies, ghouls, sylphs,guests, swarths, freiths, freits, gy carlins (Gyre carling), pigmies,chittifaces, nixies, Jinny burnt tails, dudmen, hell hounds,dopple gangers, boggleboes, bogies, redmen, portunes, grants, hobbits,hobgoblins, brown men, cowies, dunnies, wirrikows, alholdes, mannikins,follets, korreds, lubberkins, cluricauns, kobolds, leprechauns, kors,mares, korreds, puckles korigans, sylvans, succubuses, blackmen, shadows,banshees, lian hanshees, clabbernappers, Gabriel hounds, mawkins, doubles,corpse lights or candles, scrats, mahounds, trows, gnomes, sprites, fates,fiends, sibyls, nicknevins, whitewomen, fairies, thrummy caps, cutties,and nisses, and apparitions of every shape, make, form, fashion, kind anddescription, that there was not a village in England that had not its ownpeculiar ghost.Nay, every lone tenement, castle, or mansion house, which could boastof any antiquity had its bogle, its specter, or its knocker. The churches,churchyards, and crossroads were all haunted. Every green lane had itsboulder stone on which an apparition kept watch at night. Every common hadits circle of fairies belonging to it. And there was scarcely a shepherdto be met with who had not seen a spirit!
