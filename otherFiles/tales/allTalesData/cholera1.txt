Even today there are many people in Pomerania who believe that cholera was intentionally brought into the country in 1831. It is said that a Frenchman did this in order to depopulate the country, and thus make it easier to capture once again. To achieve this the French attempted to sneak into the country in many ways und with many disguises.The following account about Stettin is told even today:One day a man carrying a large chest on his back entered the city through the Berlin Gate. He looked about fearfully in all directions and attempted to pass by the sentinels without being seen. However, he was noticed and taken to the guard house. They demanded that he open the chest. At first he refused, but finally he had to obey their commands.In the large chest they found a smaller one, and in this one a still smaller one. Thus it continued for a time, until at last they opened the smallest one. Here they found a tiny, tiny human. He was the Frenchman who wanted to bring cholera into the city.
