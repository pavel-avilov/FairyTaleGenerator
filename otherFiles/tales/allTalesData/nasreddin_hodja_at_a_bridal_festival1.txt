One day Nasreddin Hodja went to a bridal festival. The master of the feast observing his old and wretched garments, paid him no consideration whatever. The Hodja saw that he had no chance of notice. so going out he hurried to his house, and putting on a splendid pelisse, returned to the place of festival.No sooner did he enter the door than the master advanced to meet him, and saying, "Welcome, Nasreddin Hodja," with all imaginable honor and reverence placed him at the head of the table, and said, "Please to eat, Lord Hodja."Forthwith the Hodja taking hold of one of the furs of his pelisse, said, "Welcome, my pelisse, please to eat, my lord."The master, looking at the Hodja with great suprise, said, "What are you about?"Whereupon the Hodja replied, "It is quite evident that all the honor paid is paid to my pelisse, so let it have some food too."
