I used to know a woman who knew she had seen the three Nephites. That was old Sister Ashby. She was living alone at the time. They were all alone and the baby was awfully sick, and she couldn't get help of any kind.She said these three men came into the room. They didn't open the door at all, but just appeared in the room. And they administered to the sick child and prayed with her and helped her there a little. And then they left the same way. She was sure they were the Nephites, and I've heard her tell it.Q: And there were three of them all together?A: Yes, all three of them.Q: Where did this take place?A: That was in Holden. Of course Mrs. Ashby has been dead a long time now, but she told me about this herself.Oral version from notes.Fillmore, Utah, September 18, 1945).Informant: Mrs. E. B. Theobald.
