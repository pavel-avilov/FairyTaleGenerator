Before leaving on a journey a poor merchant left his ironware with a rich merchant for safekeeping. Upon returning he came to the rich merchant and asked for the return of his goods.However, the rich merchant had sold everything, and to defend himself he said, "Something unfortunate happened to your goods.""What?""I stored your ironware in my granary where there are a lot of mice, and they gnawed it all to pieces. If you don't believe me, come and see for yourself."The poor merchant did nothing. "Why bother?" he said. "I believe it. Mice are always eating iron. Good bye."The poor merchant went away. On the street he saw a little boy playing. it was the rich merchant's son. Caressing him, he took the boy by the hand he and took him home with him.The next day the rich merchant met and told him about his misfortune, asking him if he knew anything about his missing son.The poor man responded, "Yes, I saw him yesterday just as I was leaving your house. A hawk flew down and carried your son away.""Don't make fun of me!" cried the rich merchant with anger. "No one can believe that a hawk could carry off a child.""I am not making fun of you. It should surprise no one that a hawk could carry off a child. If mice can eat a hundred pounds of iron anything is possible."The rich merchant understood what he meant. "The mice did not eat your iron," he said. "I sold it, and I shall reimburse you double its value.""If that's the way it is, the hawk did not carry off your son. I shall return him to you."
