(The fox and the wolf together came into possession of a piece of land.)It was oats that they set that year, and they reaped it, and they began todivide it."Well, then," said the fox, "wouldst thou rather have the root or the tip?Thou shalt have thy choice.""I'd rather the root," said the wolf.Then the fox had fine oaten bread all the year, and the other one hadfodder.On the next year they set a crop. and it was potatoes that they set, andthey grew well."Which wouldst thou like best, the root or the crop this year?" said thefox."Indeed, thou shalt not take the twist out of me anymore. I will have thetop this year," quoth the wolf."Good enough, my hero," said the fox.Thus the wolf had the potato tops, and the fox the potatoes. But the wolfused to keep stealing the potatoes from the fox.
