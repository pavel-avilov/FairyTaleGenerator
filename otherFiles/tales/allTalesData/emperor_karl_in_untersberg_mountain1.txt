In this marvelous mountain sits Emperor Karl, a golden crown on his head,his scepter in his hand, and accompanied by other princely and noblelords. He went into a trance at Great Walserfeld, and has kept the sameform that he had during his mortal life. His beard is grey and long,entirely covering his golden breastplate. On special occasions he divideshis beard into two parts, half on his right side and half on his left,each tied with a precious pearl band. The emperor has a keen and profoundlook, and he is friendly and sociable toward all of his subjects who walkback and forth with him across a beautiful meadow. No one knows why he isthere and what he intends to do. These remain mysteries of God.Franz Sartori claims that it is Emperor Karl V., but others say that it isFrederick, who sits at a table around which his beard has grown more thantwo times. As soon as the the beard has reached the last corner of thetable for the third time, the last days of the earth will have arrived.The Antichrist will appear. a battle will be fought on the fields at Wals.angels will sound their trumpets. and Judgment Day will have begun.
