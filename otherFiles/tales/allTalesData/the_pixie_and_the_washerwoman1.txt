Notwithstanding the usual unamiable character given to the pixies of Dartmoor, they are said to aid occasionally in household work. A cottage at Belstone, near Okehampton, is pointed out as having been a favourite scene of their labours. It was common to find great additions made to the "web" of cloth, morning after morning. and the pixies were frequently heard working at the loom all through the night.Plates of honey and cream, but especially a basin of pure water, must be regularly placed for them in such houses as they frequent. and it is not safe to add a more valuable reward.A washerwoman was one morning greatly surprised, on coming down stairs, to find all her clothes neatly washed and folded. She watched the next evening, and observed a pixy in the act of performing this kind office for her. but she was ragged and mean in appearance, and Betty's gratitude was sufficiently great to induce her to prepare a yellow petticoat and a red cap for the obliging pixy.She placed them, accordingly, by the side of the basin of water, and watched for the result. The pixy, after putting them on, disappeared through the window, apparently in great delight. But Betty was ever afterwards obliged to wash all her clothes herself.
