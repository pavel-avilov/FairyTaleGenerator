A tambourinist had so contrary a wife, he never could get her to do anything he asked.One day, on their way to a wedding, at which he was to play, she was riding an ass and carrying his tambourine, and he cried out, as they were fording a river, "Woman, don't play the tambourine, for you'll frighten the ass."No sooner said than she began thrumming. The ass, shying, lost its footing, and threw our dame into the river. while the husband, however much he wished to help her, could do no good.Seeing she was drowned, he went upstream in search of her body."My good fellow," said a looker on, "what are you seeking?""My wife," replied he, "who is drowned.""And you are looking for her upstream, friend?""Oh, yes, sir, she was always contrary."
