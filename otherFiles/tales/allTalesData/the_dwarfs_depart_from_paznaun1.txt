The dwarfs in the Paznaun Valley, especially in the vicinity of the little village of See, were very good natured, helping out however they could with housework. They also were happy to herd livestock....A peasant from See engaged a dwarf as a goatherd. Every day the dwarf collected the goats near the village   but he never entered the village itself   and led them out to the pasture. In the evening he brought them back close to the village, then disappeared into the mountains.The peasants sent his noonday meal to him in a very original manner: They tied it to the horns of a billy goat. The dwarf untied it and ate it with pleasure. He would not touch it if they gave it to him in a different manner.Once the peasants wanted to surprise him, so in the same manner they sent him a handsome red jacket. Seeing the jacket he sadly said to himself: "Now I can no longer herd goats, for they have given me a red jacket."He then went into the mountains and was never again seen in the valley.Similar legends are told in Etschland.
