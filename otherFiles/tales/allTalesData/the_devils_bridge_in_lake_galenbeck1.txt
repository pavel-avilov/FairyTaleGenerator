In Lake Galenbeck (in the vicinity of Friedland) there is a tongue ofland, probably artificial, that stretches about to the middle of the lake.It is called the devil's bridge, and is said to be the remains of a bridgestarted, but never completed, by the devil.A shepherd had to drive his herd completely around the lake in order toreach his pasture. This annoyed him, and one day he wished with a cursethat a bridge went across the lake. He had scarcely uttered this wish whena man appeared before him. The man promised to build a bridge in onenight, before the rooster crowed three times, under the condition that theshepherd would then belong to him. The shepherd entered into thisagreement.That evening when he arrived home, he told his wife what had happened.She said nothing, but at midnight she went to the chicken coop andawakened the rooster, who thought that it was already morning, and crowedthree times.The devil heard this. He was not finished with his work, and angrilyflew off through the air without completing the bridge.
