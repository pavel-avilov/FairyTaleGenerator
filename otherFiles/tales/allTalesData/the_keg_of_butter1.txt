The russet dog and the wild dog (the fox and the wolf) were goingtogether. And they went round about the seashore, and they found a keg ofbutter, and they buried it.On the morrow the fox went out, and when he returned, he said that aman had come to ask him to a baptism. The fox went, and he arrayed himselfin excellent attire, and he went away. And where should he go but to thebutter keg. And when he came home, the wolf asked him, "What name wasgiven to the child?"And he said that it was Foveeal (under its mouth).On the morrow the fox said that a man had sent to ask him to a baptism.And he went to the keg, and he took out about half.The wolf asked, when he came home, "What name was given to thechild?""Well," said he, "It is a queer name that I myself would not give to myman child, if I had one. It is Moolay Moolay (about half and half)."On the morrow the fox said that a man had come to ask him to a baptismagain. And he went to the keg, and he ate it all up. When he came home,the wolf asked him, "What name was given to the child?"And he said that it was Booill Eemlich (licking all up).On the morrow the fox said to the wolf that they ought to bring the keghome. They went, and when they reached the keg, there was not a shadow ofthe butter in it."Well," said the fox, "you came here without me!"The other one swore that he had not come near it."You need not be claiming that you did not come here. I know that youdid come, and that it was you who took the butter. And when we go home, Iwill see if you ate the butter," said the fox.When they arrived home, the fox hung the wolf by his hind legs, withhis head dangling below him. Then he put a dab of the butter under thewolf's mouth, as though it had come out of the wolf's belly."You red thief!" said the fox. "I said before, that it was you who atethe butter!"
