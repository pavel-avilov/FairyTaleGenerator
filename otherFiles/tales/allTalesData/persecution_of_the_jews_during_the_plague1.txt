In the fourteenth century the legend spread throughout all of Europe that the Jews had caused the black death by poisoning wells and waterways. It was claimed that this criminal activity was directed from Toledo through messengers and letters from secret leaders. It was claimed that letters had been discovered in such places as Ulm that were written at the time time of Christ's crucifixion by Jews in Jerusalem to their fellow Jews. The contents of these letters enflamed the vengeful mobs. The horrific consequences of this delusion are too well known to be recounted here.In Strasbourg 900 Jews were burned to death (of the 1884 who lived there). In Mainz the numerous Jews who lived in the city voluntarily met their deaths when their houses were set afire. Similarly, large numbers of Jews were burned to death in Augsburg, Ulm, Konstanz, Hall, Munich, Salzburg, Erfurt, and Eisenach.
