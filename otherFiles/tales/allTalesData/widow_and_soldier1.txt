A widow whose husband had been hanged in chains was keeping vigil by the corpse the first night and tearfully beseeching the sentinel who guarded it to let her steal it."Madam," he said, "I can no longer resist your entreaties. your beauty overcomes my sense of duty. I will deliver the body to you and take its place in the cage, where a stroke of my dagger will baffle justice and give me the happiness of dying for so lovely a lady.""No," said the lady, "I cannot consent to the sacrifice of so noble a life. If indeed you look upon me with favor, assist me and my servants to remove the sacred object to my chateau, where you shall remain in concealment until we can escape from the country.""Nay," said the sentinel, "I should surely be discovered and torn from your arms. In three days you can claim the body of your beloved husband. then you can confer upon an honorable soldier such happiness and distinction as you may think his devotion merits.""Three days!" the lady exclaimed. "That is long for waiting and short for flight. If unencumbered we may reach the frontier. Already the day begins to break   let us leave the body and set out."
