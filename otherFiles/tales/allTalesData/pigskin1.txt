In a Little Russian (Ukrainian) variant of one of those numerous stories, current in all lands, which commence with the escape of the heroine from an incestuous union, a priest insists on marrying his daughter. She goes to her mother's grave and weeps there.Her dead mother "comes out from her grave," and tells her what to do. The girl obtains from her father a rough dress of pig's skin, and two sets of gorgeous apparel. the former she herself assumes, in the latter she dresses up three Kuklui , which in this instance were probably mere blocks of wood.Then she takes her place in the midst of the dressed up forms, which cry, one after the other, "Open, O moist earth, that the fair maiden may enter within thee!"The earth opens, and all four sink into it.
