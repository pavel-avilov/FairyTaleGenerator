The Bogey Man is so terribly tall,The Bogey Man is as high as the wall,The Bogey Man is intended to fallOn violent, truculent folks.The Bogey Man is the nurs'ry police,There isn't a nephew, nor is there a niece,But of whose folly he knows every piece,And his horrible wrath it provokes."We told you he'd catch you," my family said,When I was a youngster. and there by the bedHe seemed to be standing, all green, blue, and red,And every sort of a hue.I thought he would leap in the dark with a cryAnd carry me off to his home in the sky  But he never did yet, for here still am I  So I don't believe that it's true.
