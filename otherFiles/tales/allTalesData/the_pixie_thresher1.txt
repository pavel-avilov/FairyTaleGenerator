The following story of a fairy in the capacity of the benevolent sprite used to be told in one of the southern counties of England:Once upon a time there was a young woman who married a thresher. Soon he turned out to be a hopeless drunkard. his work was neglected, and starvation stared them in the face. So the woman dressed herself in her husband's clothes, and went to the barn to do the threshing whilst he slept off the effects of his drunkenness.On the morning of the second day she found her pile of threshed corn double what she had left there overnight, and this increase was repeated for three or four nights in succession. She determined to watch one night and discover who was her unknown helper. Presently she beheld a little pixy come into the barn, and set to work vigorously to thresh the corn, and as he swung his flail he sang:Little pixy fair and slim,Without a rag to cover him.Out of pity and gratitude, the woman next day made him a tiny suit of clothes, and hung them up behind the barn door beside his flail. At night when the pixy returned to work, he saw the clothes, and put them on at once. Then, surveying himself with satisfaction, he sang:Pixy fine and Pixy gay,Pixy now must fly away.With that he disappeared, and never came back any more.
