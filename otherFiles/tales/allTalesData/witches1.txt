Witches are not popular in Ireland nowadays. They were generally old hags who by the evil power they possessed could charm away butter, or compound love potions, or at most assume the form of a hare and suck the milk from their neighbor's cows before the sunlight touched the dew.There is a story common to every rural district in Ireland of a witch who was surprised in the act by a huntsman, and on being pursued by the dogs fled to a cabin where, having assumed her natural shape, she was discovered spinning, with the blood streaming from a wound in her side.
