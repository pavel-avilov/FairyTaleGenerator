One night as a priest was going from Hiorlunde to Rolskilde ( sic ), he passed by a mount in which there were music, dancing and other merriment.At this moment someDwarfs sprang forth from the mount, stopped the priest's vehicle, and said, "Whither art thou going?""To Landemode," answered the priest.They then asked him whether he thought they could be saved. to which he replied that he could not then inform them. They then appointed him to meet them with an answer in a year.In the meantime it went ill with the coachman, who the next time he passed by the mount was overturned and killed on the spot.When the priest came again at the end of a year, they again asked him the same question, to which he answered, "No! You are all damned!"Scarcely had he uttered the words before the whole mount was in a blaze.
