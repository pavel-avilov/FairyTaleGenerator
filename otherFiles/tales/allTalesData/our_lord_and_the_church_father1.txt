A church father, as it happens now and again, made a gift to his church. It was a magnificent candelabra with a large wax candle. Our Lord appeared to him in the form of an old man and promised him that as thanks for this gift he would forewarn the church father three times about death before calling him from this earth.Happy about this, the church father led a merry and lavish life, eating and drinking to his heart's content. He took every advantage of the church's winecellar. Living such a life, he never thought about death.However, after a few years his body began to give in. His knees failed him. His back bent downward. He could walk only with the aid of a crutch. Not long afterward he lost his sight, and then his hearing as well.Crippled, blind, and deaf as he was, he nonetheless continued the same frivolous life as before.Finally our Lord came to take him away. The church father was surprised and angry. He complained as to why he had not been forewarned three times as promised.To this our Lord spoke with justified anger: "What? Did I not forewarn you? Did I not at first knock on your armpits and knees causing you to walk crookedly? Did I not touch your eyes with my finger causing you to lose your sight? Did I not pull your ears causing you to lose your hearing? My promise to you has been fulfilled. Follow after me!"The church father humbly begged for forgiveness, saying that he truthfully had not understood the messages and thus had not prepared himself for death.Our Lord looked gently at the penitent church father and said: "Just come with me. I will treat you more with mercy than with justice!"You all must take note of this: Our Lord is forewarning you as well. Be sure that when he calls for you, you are not as unprepared as was this church father.
