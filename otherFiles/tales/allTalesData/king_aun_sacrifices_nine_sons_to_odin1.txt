King Aun returned to Uppsala when he was sixty years of age. He made a great sacrifice, and in it offered up his son to Odin. Aun got an answer from Odin, that he should live sixty years longer. and he was afterwards king in Uppsala for twenty five years.Now came Ale the Bold, a son of King Fridleif, with his army to Svithiod against King Aun....Then Aun fled a second time to West Gautland. and for twenty five years Ale reigned in Uppsala, until he was killed by Starkad the Old.After Ale's fall, Aun returned to Uppsala and ruled the kingdom for twenty five years. Then he made a great sacrifice again for long life, in which he sacrificed his second son, and received the answer from Odin, that he should live as long as he gave him one of his sons every tenth year, and also that he should name one of the districts of his country after the number of sons he should offer to Odin. When he had sacrificed the seventh of his sons he continued to live for ten years. but so that he could not walk, but was carried on a chair. Then he sacrificed his eighth son, and lived thereafter ten years, lying in his bed. Now he sacrificed his ninth son, and lived ten years more. but so that he drank out of horn like an infant.He had now only one son remaining, whom he also wanted to satrifice, and to give Odin Uppsala and the domains thereunto belonging, under the name of the Tenth Land, but the Sweedes would not allow it. so there was no sacrifice, and King Aun died, and was buried in a mound at Uppsala. Since that time it is called Aun's sickness when a man dies, without pain, of extreme old age.Thiodolf tells of this:In Uppsala town the cruel kingSlaughtered his sons at Odin's shrine  Slaughtered his sons with cruel knife,To get from Odin length of lifeHe lived until he had to turnHis toothless mouth to the deer's horn.And he who shed his children's bloodSucked through the ox's horn his food,At length fell Death has tracked him down,Slowly, but sure, in Uppsala town.
