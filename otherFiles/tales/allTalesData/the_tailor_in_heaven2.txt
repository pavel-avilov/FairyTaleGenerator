When the first tailor was admitted into heaven everyone there was very happy, because such an event was so rare and unexpected. Therefore God sponsored a festive procession in the tailor's honor. Because tailors are an unusual type, and are especially vain, our tailor felt himself too good to participate in the procession. instead he remained at home and looked around heaven.He came to the divine throne, climbed onto it, and sat down. At the side he noticed a window, which he opened and looked down onto earth. From here he could see everything that was happening on earth. There he saw another tailor seated at his window who was just about to steal a small hank of yarn. This angered our tailor so much that he broke off the leg of a chair and threw it at the tailor's head.When God returned and saw the broken chair he asked the tailor what he had done, to which the tailor eagerly described everything he had seen.But then God said, "If I had acted this way every time that you stole something, throwing a chair leg at your head, there would not be another one here at all."Then the tailor was forced out of heaven, and   so they say   another one has never been admitted. I would like to know if that is true.
