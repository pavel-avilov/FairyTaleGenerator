In a small hut far up in the mountains there lived an old man with four small children. They were his grandchildren. He loved them very much and took good care of them.Whenever he went into the village to buy food he would say to his grandchildren, "Dear little children! If anyone comes to the door do not let them inside. Some day the wolf might come by, and he would eat you up!"Once he went into the village, and the wolf did come to the door and called out, "Dear children, open the door for me!"The children thought about their grandfather's warning not to open the door, and they said nothing.Then the wolf said, "Open up! Your grandfather sent me!"Then the oldest child said, "Why did grandfather send you?"The wolf answered, "He sent a sweet cake for you!"The children could no longer resist. They opened the door. The wolf sprang inside and ate up all four of the children. He looked around in the room to see if he might find something else to eat. He found a large bottle filled with brandy. He put the bottle to his mouth and drank it empty. He became so drunk that he could not move from the spot and had to lie down in the hut.Toward evening the grandfather returned home and saw the snoring wolf lying on the floor in the middle of the room. At once he knew what had happened to his grandchildren. He took a sharp knife and slit open the wolf's belly. The children jumped out, and the grandfather hid them.Then the grandfather took some dry lime, filled the wolf's belly with it, and then sewed the opening shut. When the wolf woke up he was thirsty and ran to the brook, where he drank a lot of water. The lime in his belly began to boil and to burn. The wolf burst apart and died a miserable death.
