Seems like I did hear a story about one of the Nephites once. Don't know if I can remember it or not, though. It was along time ago when I heard it. It was out there on the road between Lyndal and Delta. You know what kind of country that is   just flat desert for about forty miles. Well, this feller   I think it was old John Rogers   was goin' along and he saw an old man on the road. So he stopped and asked him if he wanted a ride. but he said no, he didn't want any ride. And seems like they talked there for quite awhile, and when old John Rogers had drove off   maybe forty yards down the road   he looked around and couldn't see the old feller nowhere.Q: Did the old man give him any advice or help or did he prophesy anything?A: Seems like he did. I think it was my Grandmother Melville told the story a long time ago. Maybe it was in church. Seems like she said he predicted something, but I can't remember what. Maybe it was that Delta would have the third largest population in the state. And when you count Topaz (Japanese relocation center) that almost makes it come true.Q: Did Rogers think it was one of the Nephites?A: Oh, yes. He said he was sure it was.Oral version from notes.Fillmore, Utah, September 16, 1945.Informant: Sheldon Trimble.Collector: Hector Lee.
