In Heron's collection of God's judgments on wicked acts, it is related of an unnatural son, who fed his aged father upon oats and offal, lodged him in a filthy and crazy garret, and clothed him in sackcloth, while he and his wife and children lived in luxury. that, having bought sackcloth enough for two dresses for his father, the children took away the part not made up, and hid it, and that, upon asking them what they would do this for, they told him that they meant to keep it for him, when he should become old and walk with a stick!This, the author relates, pierced his heart. and, indeed, if this failed, he must have had the heart of a tiger.
