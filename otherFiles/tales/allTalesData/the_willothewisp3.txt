On the southwest side of the Ihlower Forest there is a large, overgrown swamp. In stormy nights a large will o' the wisp appears there. This is not an ordinary will o' the wisp, but rather a punishment will o' the wisp sent by God.At the place where this light appears there was formerly a pond, and still earlier a hill was there. There was a chapel on this hill (before there was a monastery in the forest). All Christians in the area, including the young girls, would go to this chapel to pray and for confession. The priest there was a crude fellow, and he presented the young maidens with more than just the mass. He defiled them.When his sinfulness became unbearable, the earth opened one terrible night, and he was was swallowed underground, complete with the hill and the chapel.Since that night the will o' the wisp hovers over the area as a sign of God's punishment.
