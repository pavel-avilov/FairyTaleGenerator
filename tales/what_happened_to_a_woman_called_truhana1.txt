A woman named Truhana, who was not very rich, went one day to market, carrying on her head a jar of honey. Along the road she was calculating how she could sell the honey and buy eggs, these eggs would produce chickens, and with the produce of the sale of these latter she would buy lambs. and in this way was calculating how she would become richer than her neighbors, and looked forward with anxiety to well marrying her sons and daughters, and how she would go through the streets, accompanied by her sons and daughters in law, and how the people would say what a fortunate woman she was to become so rich, having been so very poor.Under the influence of these pleasurable thoughts, she laughed heartily. when, suddenly striking the jar with her hand, it fell to the ground and was broken.Seeing this, she was in great grief at being so suddenly deprived of all her flattering anticipations. for, having fixed all her thoughts upon an illusion, she lost that which was real.
