It is only when the joke hinges upon something which is peculiar to a people that it is likely to be found among that people only. But most of the Russian jests turn upon pivots which are familiar to all the world, and have for their themes such common place topics as the incorrigible folly of man, the inflexible obstinacy of woman. And in their treatment of these subjects they offer very few novel features.It is strange how far a story of this kind may travel, and yet how little alteration it may undergo. Take, for instance, the skits against women which are so universally popular. Far away in outlying districts of Russia we find the same time honored quips which have so long figured in collections of English facetiae.There is the good old story, for instance, of the dispute between a husband and wife as to whether a certain rope has been cut with a knife or with scissors, resulting in the murder of the scissors upholding wife, who is pitched into the river by her knife advocating husband. but not before she has, in her very death agony, testified to her belief in the scissors hypothesis by a movement of her fingers above the surface of the stream.In a Russian form of the story, told in the government of Astrakhan, the quarrel is about the husband's beard. He says he has shaved it, his wife declares he has only cut it off. He flings her into a deep pool, and calls to her to say "shaved."Utterance is impossible to her, but "she lifts one hand above the water and by means of two fingers makes signs to show that it was cut."The story has even settled into a proverb. Of a contradictory woman the Russian peasants affirm that, "If you say 'shaved' she'll say 'cut.'"In the same way another story shows us in Russian garb our old friend the widower who, when looking for his drowned wife   a woman of a very antagonistic disposition   went up the river instead of down, saying to his astonished companions, "She always did everything contrary wise, so now, no doubt, she's gone against the stream."
