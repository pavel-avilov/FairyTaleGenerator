In Jagel, near Schleswig, there was once a host who observed with vexation that his beer always ran out too fast, without his knowing how. But one day, when on his way from the city, where he had been to fetch a fresh supply, he heard, on passing the Jagelberg, where there is a giant grave, a voice crying in a tone of lamentation, "Pingel is dead! Pingel is dead!"On his return home he related what he had heard to his wife, and had scarcely uttered the words when a little underground man came rushing out of the cellar, and crying:Ach, is Pingel tot, is Pingel tot,So hab ich hier Bier genug geholt,Ah, if Pingel's dead, if Pingel's dead,Then have I fetched beer enough,and then ran off. A jug was afterwards found in the cellar standing by the beer cask, which the little man had left behind. for it was for the sick Pingel that he had stolen the beer.
