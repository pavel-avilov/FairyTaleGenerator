Fully three thousand years ago, our neighbor had a lot of grain in his barn. Every morning he found a part of this grain threshed, with sheaves laid out on the threshing floor for the next day. He could not explain how this came to be. One evening he hid in a corner of the barn and saw a little man come in and start to thresh the grain.Because the little man was naked, the farmer said to himself, "I have to give him a nice little coat for his labor."He then said to his wife, "It is a little man who comes to thresh our grain. you will have to make him a little coat."The next day, the woman took all kinds of cloth pieces, and made a little suit from them. The farmer placed the suit on the pile of grain. The sprite returned the following night, and, threshing the grain, he found the suit.In his joy he began to skip about, saying, "Whoever serves a good master shall receive a good wage."Then he put on the suit, and found himself very handsome. "I have been paid for my labor, but who will now thresh the grain?"Having said that, he left and never returned.
