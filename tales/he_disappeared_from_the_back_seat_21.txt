Bishop Morgan was telling about a Greek family that weren't converts of the Church but were sure that they had met one of the Three Nephites.... They were riding from Price to Salt Lake around conference time and met an old man on the road around Soldier Summit. They offered him a ride. He got in and they pushed the catch on the door down because they were used to having children in the car. They got on the way and were talking among themselves and turned around and looked but they couldn't see him. He had said just before that he was going to the gathering of the Saints. They turned around and went all the way back to Soldier Summit but they couldn't find him.Oral version from shorthand notes.Price, Utah, July 24, 1946.Informant: Miss Warner (Age, about 35).Collectors: Austin and Alta Fife.
