One day a poor and aged manPassed through the thriving cityAnd meekly ask'd of those he sawFor food and rest in pity.But all so cold their hearts had grown,With cares and fashions splendid,The homeless passed on aloneFaint, worn, and unbefriended.* * * * * * *Outside the town a cottage stood,The house of shepherd Malcolm,Who took him in and gave him food,And rest, and warmth, and welcome.Next morning, standing at the door,He looked towards the city,And raised his hand and murmured o'erThe words of this strange ditty:Semerwater rise! Semerwater sink!And bury the town all, save the houseWhere they gave me meat and drink.* * * * * * *And still, when boating on the lakeWhen sunset clouds are glowing,The roofs and spires may yet be seenBeneath the blue waves showing.And as the calm of evening falls,No sound from landward bringingSoft music heard from hidden bellsDeep 'neath the waters ringing.The origin of the curious legend concerning Semmerdale no one seems to know, yet it is very probable some calamity in the shape of a landslip or a convulsion of nature has taken place here, causing disaster to people dwelling on its banks.The legend says:Near the beginning of the Christian era there stood a fair city on the site of the present lake, at that time only a mountain rivulet. One cold winter's day there wandered through its streets an angel in the guise of a poor venerable man, scant of clothing, hungry, and with no money in his scrip wherewith to buy food and raiment. In vain he begged for food and shelter, but no one gave relief.Passing along the east side of the vale, just without the bounds of the city, stood a small hut, the dwelling place of an aged couple, too lowly, the legend says, to be allowed to dwell within the precincts of the city. To this humble dwelling came the beggar, but even before he told of his hunger the good dame placed milk, cheese and bread before him. After satisfying his appetite he bestowed on the kind couple a blessing.Beneath their roof he found shelter for the night, and next morning, after again thanking the aged people, he spread his hands to the proud oity and pronounced the following malediction: "Semmerwater rise! Semmerwater sink!" etc.Then the earth made a hissing noise, the stream grew into a large lake, and the city was no more.Yet unto this day the natives tell us that the roofs of the buried city are ofttimes seen deep down in the limpid waters. They also point to a hut still standing on the south side of the lake as the dwelling place of the aged couple who so generously relieved the stranger.
