One time Old Man said to Old Woman, "People will never die."Oh! " said Old Woman, "that will never do. because, if people livealways, there will be too many people in the world.""Well," said, Old Man, "we do not want to die forever. We shall die forfour days and then come to life again.""Oh, no!" said Old Woman, "it will be better to die forever, so that weshall be sorry for each other.""Well," said Old Man, "we will decide this way. We will throw a buffalochip into the water. If it sinks, we will die forever. if it floats, weshall live again.""Well," said Old Woman, "throw it in."Now, Old Woman had great power, and she caused the chip to turn into astone, so it sank. So when we die, we die forever.
