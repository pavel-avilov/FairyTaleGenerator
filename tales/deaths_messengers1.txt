Death entered into a pact with a young man, agreeing not to come for him without first sending messengers in advance. Some years later Death appeared, saying, "Your time has come.""But you did not send your messengers in advance," said the man. "You can't take me yet.""Has your sight not dimmed?" asked Death. "Is not your hair thin and gray? Your back hunched? Your arms weak? And your once long stride now a feeble shuffle?""That is true," admitted the man, then started to protest anew."Those were my messengers," said Death, interrupting him abruptly. "Your failure to recognize them changes nothing. Your time has come."
