Once upon a time there were seven robbers who lived inside a mountain, and with them there was an enchanted prince who had to do all the lowest work. He had to carry wood, fetch coal, and tend the fire, and everything that a kitchen maid ordinarily would do. The robbers called him "Hans Dunsele."One day the robbers brought into the mountain a princess whom they had abducted. Once while she was silently sitting in a corner she heard the enchanted prince singing to himself at his work:If only the queen knewThat I am called Hans Dunsele!One day as the robbers were leaving, the princess hid herself and heard one of them call out: "Open Simson!"Then the mountain opened up, they went out, and the mountain closed itself again.She immediately told this to the prince, and the two of them decided to escape. They made preparations, and one day when the robbers were away, the princess said, "Open Simson!"The mountain opened up, and they could freely leave. They went far, far into the woods, which became thicker and thicker, until they could no longer find a pathway.Then the prince uttered the saying that he had so often sung to himself:If only the queen knewThat I am called Hans Dunsele!Now the queen, his mother, had set forth in search of her enchanted son, and she just happened to be nearby while he was singing, and thus she learned the name that he had had with the robbers.She called out loudly and cheerfully: "Hans Dunsele!"With that the spell was broken. the woods thinned out, and they found the pathway homeward.Afterward he married the princess who had helped him escape from the mountain and had fled together with him, and he lived happily with her until he died.
