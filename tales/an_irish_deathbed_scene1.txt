In the year of grace 1793, an aged peasant, whose cabin neighboured my then residence, lay in extremis , lovingly tended by his wife and daughter. The Christmas Eve was nearing its close, and they religiously believed that, should he pass away at its synchronism with the Christmas morning, he would escape purgatory, and directly enter paradise.The church clock began to strike twelve . The wife took the bolster from under the dying man's head and pressed it down on his face. the daughter seated herself on his breast. and their purpose accomplished. no secret being made of the deed   no wonder manifested   no notice taken.Was this murder? So far from possessing murder's primary condition   malice   it was done in all affection and piety. The husband and father could not survive another hour. a moment's quickened suffering would secure to him (so the simple women imagined) a painless eternity.Can anybody tell me the origin of this superstition, which brings to one's mind the more gentle influence of Christmas Tide, as described in Hamlet ?Juverna.
