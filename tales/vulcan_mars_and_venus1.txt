The MetamorphosesThe Sun, who rules all things by his ethereal light, ... is supposed to have been the first to see the adultery of Venus with Mars. this God is the first to see everything. He was grieved at what was done, and showed to the husband (Vulcan), the son of Juno, the wrong done to his bed, and the place of the intrigue. Both his senses, and the work which his skillful right hand was then holding, quitted him on the instant.Immediately he files out some slender chains of brass, and nets, and meshes, which can escape the eye. The finest threads cannot surpass that work, nor yet the cobweb that hangs from the top of the beam. He makes it so, too, as to yield to a slight touch, and a gentle movement, and skillfully arranges it drawn around the bed.When the wife and the gallant come into the same bed, being both caught through the artifice of the husband, and chains prepared by this new contrivance, they are held fast in the very midst of their embraces.The Lemnian God immediately threw open the folding doors of ivory, and admitted the Deities. There they lay disgracefully bound. And yet many a one of the Gods, not the serious ones, could fain wish thus to become disgraced. The Gods of heaven laughed, and for a long time was this the most noted story in all heaven.
