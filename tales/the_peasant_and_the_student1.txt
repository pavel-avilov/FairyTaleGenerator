Once in wintertime a student found shelter with a peasant. Taking a place next to the stove, the student blew onto his hands. The peasant asked him why he was doing that, to which the student answered that he was warming his hands with his breath.The peasant then invited him to stay for dinner. The student blew on his soup, and the peasant asked him why was doing that."To cool off the soup with my breath," was the answer."Oho!" said the peasant. "Are you one of those who can blow hot and cold out of their mouths? Be on your way! I learned from my father to be wary of anyone who blows hot and cold out of his mouth."
