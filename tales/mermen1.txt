Mermen formerly lived in the Seeben Pond (also known as Glaswald Lake), which is unfathomably deep. They were the same size as children and formed above like humans and below like fish. They could make themselves invisible.One of them befriended the people at the Seeben Farm (which lies next to a hill three quarters of an hour down from the lake). He would awaken them every morning and stay with them until evening, when he returned to the lake. He did chores for them all day, and was especially helpful with their livestock, which flourished better than ever before.However, whenever they gave him a task they always had to say, "Not too little and not too much!" otherwise he would do too little or too much.Every day at the farmhouse they gave him his breakfast, noon meal, and evening meal, which they placed under the steps, where he sat by himself and ate. Although his clothes, including his floppy hat, were sorely worn out, and his jacket was badly ripped, the farmers at the Seeben Farm refrained from providing him with new clothes. However when winter came they secretly had a new jacket made for him, which they gave to him one evening.To this the merman said, "When one has been paid, then one must leave. From tomorrow onward I'll not come back to you."The farmer tried to assure him that the jacket was a gift and not a loan, but he could not dissuade the merman from his intention.Angered at this, the maid servant did not give the merman his evening meal, and he went away with an empty stomach. The next morning they found the maid servant dead in front of the house. She was upside down, her head having been buried in the ground.The merman was never again seen at the Seeben Farm.
