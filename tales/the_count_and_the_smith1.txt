Once upon a time there was a count, a very wicked man who tormented his people whenever he was able to. He especially vindictive against his smith, whom he despised.One day he said to him, "On this hill you are to build me a castle, or I will have you torn to pieces."When the man came home and told his wife what task had been given to him, the woman gave him a rope and said, "Go into the woods and hang yourself, then you will be safe from the count's demands."Seeing that he had no other choice, he took the rope and went into the woods.On the way he met a stranger who spoke to him, saying, "I know what you plan to do, but instead, come with me."He let him to a haystack and told him to lay down and go to sleep. The man did so. When he awoke, on the hill there was a castle surrounded by a deep moat. He quickly went to the count and showed him the castle.The count was very eager to get a closer look at the castle, and he walked up to it. However, as he was about to cross over the bridge, it collapsed, and he drowned. So the smith took possession of the castle, and he himself became a count.
