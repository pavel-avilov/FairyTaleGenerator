Old Hanrahan one time went to the forth that's in front of his house and cut a bush, and he a fresh man enough. And next morning he hadn't a blade of hair on his head   not a blade. And he had to buy a wig and wear it for the rest of his life. I remember him and the wig well.And it was some years after that that Delane, the father of the great cricketer, was passing by that way, and the water had risen and he strayed off the road into it.And as he got farther and farther in, till he was covered to better than his waist, he heard the voice of his wife crying, "Go on, John, go on farther."And he called out, "These are John Hanrahan's faeries that took the hair off him.""And what did you do then?" they asked when he got safe to the house, and was telling this.And he said, "I turned my coat inside out, and after that they troubled me no more, and so I got safe to the road again."But no one ever had luck that meddled with a forth, so it's always said.
