Once there was a boy who was supposed to tend three hundred hares, and the king had proclaimed that if he succeeded in bringing all of them back home for three evenings then he should receive the princess.He drove them out early in the morning, but the hares immediately ran away. He cried bitterly. In the evening he was supposed to have all the hares, but now he did not have a single one.Then a little man came to him and asked, "Why are you crying so much?"He told the little man that he was supposed to bring all the hares back home in the evening, but that now he did not have a single one.Then the little man asked him if he had anything to eat, and the boy answered, "Just a bit of dry bread."After the two of them had eaten the bread, the little man gave a flute to the boy, saying, "When evening comes just play on this flute, and all the hares will come to you."The boy did just that, and all the hares came to him.When he arrived back in the village, everyone was standing in front of the palace to see if he would indeed bring all the hares back, and the boy did bring all three hundred back.The next day he drove them out again, and the little man returned. They ate breakfast together, and the little man asked, "Why are you so happy?"The boy said, "All my hares came back."The little man said, "Do the same thing again this evening."And in that manner all the hares returned for three evenings.However, the king did not want to give the boy his daughter, because another young gentleman was there. Finally it was determined that the young gentleman, the boy, and the princess should all sleep together in one bed. In the morning, the person whom the princess was facing should receive her.In the middle of the night the boy went next door to a store and bought all kinds of sweets, raisins, and almonds, then got back in bed. At midnight the young gentleman asked, "What is it that smells so good on you?""Oh, I just went outside and ate some of my own dung."So the young gentleman went outside and smeared dung all over his face.Now everyone thought that the girl would be facing the young gentleman in the morning, but that was not the case. Thus the boy received the princess.
