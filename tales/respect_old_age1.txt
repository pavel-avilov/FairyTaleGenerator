Once there lived a poor man who had to support his family, the members of which were a hot headed wife who predominated over the will of her husband. a small boy of ten. and an old man of eighty, the boy's grandfather. This old man could no longer work, because of his feebleness. He was the cause of many quarrels between the husband and wife, but was loved by their son.One rainy morning the husband was forced by his wife to send his father away. He called his son, and ordered him to carry a basket full of food and also a blanket. He told the boy that they were to leave the old man in a hut on their farm some distance away. The boy wept, and protested against this harsh treatment of his grandfather, but in vain. He then cut the blanket into two parts.When he was asked to explain his action, he said to his father, "When you grow old, I will leave you in a hut, and give you this half of the blanket."The man was astonished, hurriedly recalled his order concerning his father, and thereafter took good care of him.
