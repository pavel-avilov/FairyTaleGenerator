A peasant left a jug of milk with a neighbor for safekeeping. When hereclaimed the jug, the milk had disappeared. Angry words led to a lawsuit,and the judge decreed that the neighbor should pay for the milk, eventhough the latter claimed that the flies had consumed it."You should have struck them dead," said the judge."What?" replied the peasant, "You grant me permission to killflies?""Yes indeed," responded the judge. "You have my permission to kill themanywhere you find them."In that moment the peasant saw a fly on the judge's cheek. He steppedup to him and gave him a slap, saying, "I bet that cursed fly is one ofthose who drank up the milk!"Because of the permission he had granted the peasant, the judge coulddo nothing about the slap.
