In Klein Paaren there was once a peasant who, during his lifetime,plowed away the edges of his neighbors' fields, then afterwards moved theboundary stones. Heaven punished him for this. He had scarcely diedbefore he began appearing in the night at the place where he had sinned.He was seen there busily digging at the land he had plowed away. He wasalso often seen panting and carrying a heavy boundary stone about. Hewould call out in misery, "Where shall I set it down? Where shall I setit down?"This was often heard at midnight until finally the preacher went out tothat place and said, "In God's name, set it back down where you found it."He did that, and since then he has not been seen again. It may be thathe has found redemption.
