I heard about them (i.e., the Three Nephites) when I was here seven years ago. It was out on the road between Holden and Delta, where it is flat and you can see for miles around. Don't you remember it, mother? Somebody was going along that road and these Three Nephites suddenly appeared on the road and then disappeared.Q: All three of them?A: That's as I heard it, yes. It was quite a story, but I don't remember it. That's all I can remember about it.Oral version written from notes.Fillmore, Utah, September 18, 1945.Informant: Mrs. Leo Theobold.Collector: Hector Lee.
