In the vicinity of Salzburg there once lived a musician who mastered his instrument like no one else. Whenever he played a piece everyone believed that the sounds were coming from the heavens. Sometimes the sounds penetrated the listeners' souls like a thunderstorm, but sometimes like sweetly endearing music. Brooks and rivers, trees and cliffs, humans and animals   all were captivated by his fiddle.Whenever children looked out the window while he was playing nearby, they had to dance to his music and follow after him. In this manner he lured many children into Kindskogel Mountain.Eventually when he was thus playing his fiddle in the Tauern Mountains, villages and alpine huts, priests and dairymaids, judges and witches all danced together   and even mice in the cellar, bats in the tower, and fish in Lake Zell were twisting and turning   he himself was enchanted and as punishment was turned into stone.
