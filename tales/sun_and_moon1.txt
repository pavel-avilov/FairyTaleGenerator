The heavenly bodies were once ordinary Eskimos, living upon the earth, who, for one reason or an other, have been translated to the skies. The sun was a fair woman, and the moon her brother, and they lived in the same house. She was visited every night by a man, but could not tell who it was. In order to find out, she blackened her hands with lamp soot, and rubbed them upon las back. When the morning came, it turned out to be her brother, for his white reindeer skin was all smudged. and hence come the spots on the moon.The sun seized a crooked knife, cut off one of her breasts, and threw it to him, crying: "Since my whole body tastes so good to you, eat this."Then she lighted a piece of lamp moss and rushed out. the moon did likewise and ran after her, but his moss went out, and that is why he looks like a live cinder. He chased her up into the sky, and there they still are.
