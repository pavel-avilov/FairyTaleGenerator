In the year 1709 when the plague was ravaging Prussia it also came to Konitz (Chojnice), killing many people. The citizens were beside themselves, fearing that the entire town would perish, when a strange man appeared and offered to ban the plague. His offer was accepted.He had a hole cut into a large linden tree growing in the Lutheran churchyard and made ready with a chock that fit exactly into the hole. He then led a solemn procession into the churchyard, banned the plague into the tree, then quickly drove the chock into the hole, locking the plague inside the tree. He warned the people against removing the chock, lest the plague should escape.From then onward the plague has not shown itself in Prussia. To the present day the tree with the chock is still standing.
