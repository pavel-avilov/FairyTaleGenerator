In Findeln a peasant dreamed that if he would go to Sion he would find his fortune. This he dreamed three times, and so vividly that he decided to go there and see if the dream would be fulfilled.He was just crossing the large bridge in Sion when he met a man who asked him where he was going. He replied that he had dreamed three times that he would find his fortune here, and so he wanted to see if this were true.The man laughed at him for being such a fool. He himself had dreamed that he could find his fortune at the uppermost house in the village of Findeln, but this dream left him cold.The peasant from Findeln returned home and said to himself, "Now what did that man say? In the uppermost house in the village? That is my house. I'll just have a look!"He dug and dug, and he found a pot full of gold. Thus he did indeed find his fortune in Sion.(Visperterminen)
