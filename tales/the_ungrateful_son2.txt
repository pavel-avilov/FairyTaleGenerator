We read about a father who gave all his goods to his children with the expectation that they would care for him and feed him for the rest of his life. But his children did not do this.After he had been with a child for one week they would say to him, "Now you should go somewhere else and eat there for the same amount of time."Once the father happened to come to a son who was just sitting down to eat a goose. On seeing his father, the son hid the goose under the table.After the father left, the son wanted to pick up the goose, but it had turned into a toad. The toad jumped into the son's face and ate its way into his flesh until he could not free himself from it. It stuck fast to him and devoured everything that the son tried to eat until he starved to death.This example shows how severely God punishes those who are thankless toward their parents.
