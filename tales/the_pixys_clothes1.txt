I have heard a story about an old woman in this town (Tavistock), who suspected she received assistance of the above (helpful) nature, and one evening coming suddenly into the room, she spied a ragged little creature, who jumped out at the door. She thought she would try still further to win the services of her elfin friend. and so bought some smart new clothes, as big as those made for a doll. These pretty things she placed by the side of her wheel.The pixy returned and put them on. when clapping her tiny hands in joy, she was heard to exclaim these lines (for pixies are so poetical, they always talk in rhyme):Pixy fine, pixy gay,Pixy now will run away.And off she went. but the ungrateful little creature never spun for the poor old woman after.
