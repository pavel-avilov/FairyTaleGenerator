Kisagotami (Kisa Gotami) is the name of a young girl, whose marriage with the onlyson of a wealthy man was brought about in true fairy tale fashion. She hadone child, but when the beautiful boy could run alone, it died. The younggirl, in her love for it, carried the dead child clasped to her bosom, andwent from house to house of her pitying friends asking them to give hermedicine for it.But a Buddhist mendicant, thinking "She does not understand," said toher, "My good girl, I myself have no such medicine as you ask for, but Ithink I know of one who has.""O tell me who that is," said Kisagotami."The Buddha can give you medicine. Go to him," was the answer.She went to Gautama, and doing homage to him said, "Lord and master, doyou know any medicine that will be good for my child?""Yes, I know of some," said the teacher.Now it was the custom for patients or their friends to provide theherbs which the doctors required, so she asked what herbs he wouldwant."I want some mustard seed," he said. and when the poor girl eagerlypromised to bring some of so common a drug, he added, "You must get itfrom some house where no son, or husband, or parent, or slave hasdied.""Very good," she said, and went to ask for it, still carrying her deadchild with her.The people said, "Here is mustard seed, take it."But when she asked, "In my friend's house has any son died, or husband,or a parent or slave?" they answered, "Lady, what is this that you say?The living are few, but the dead are many."Then she went to other houses, but one said, "I have lost a son".another, "We have lost our parents". another, "I have lost my slave."At last, not being able to find a single house where no one had died,her mind began to clear, and summoning up resolution, she left the deadbody of her child in a forest, and returning to the Buddha paid himhomage.He said to her, "Have you the mustard seed?""My lord," she replied, "I have not. The people tell me that the livingare few, but the dead are many."Then he talked to her on that essential part of his system   theimpermanence of all things, till her doubts were cleared away, and,accepting her lot, she became a disciple and entered the first path.
