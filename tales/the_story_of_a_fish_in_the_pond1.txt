The 1001 NightsOnce a great number of fish lived in a pond that was filled only by rainwater. It happened that one summer very little rain fell. The pond grew ever smaller, and the declining water level greatly concerned the fish.They said to one another: "What will become of us? What can we do? Who can give us advice?"Then the oldest of them came forth and said: "We can only turn to God and to the crab, the wisest of all water dwellers."The other fish all agreed, and they presented themselves before the crab, who was lying peacefully at the door of his nest. He knew nothing of the fishes' problem.The oldest of them approached him, and after greeting him, said: "You need not concern yourself with our sad situation, o wise and learned crab."The crab asked: "Just what is your problem then?"They told him about the lack of water and of their approaching downfall, then asked him for advice and support.The crab was silent for a while, thinking: "These simple fish have but little trust in God. But I shall set them at ease. God's will shall then transpire."Then he said to the fish: "Don't you fish know that the year has just begun. There is still plenty of water. It will rain again. Trust in God. Pray to him often, for he hears the prayers of his creatures. Let us wait until winter when it will rain as usual. If not we shall flee from this pond to wherever God leads us."The fish expressed approval of the crab's opinion, thanked him, and went on their way.A few days later a great rain fell from heaven and filled the pond even higher than normal.
