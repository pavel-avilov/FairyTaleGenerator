One winter evening a peasant was driving home from the town of Viljandi. While crossing the Parika Moor he noticed that a small blue flame was burning a few steps from the side of the road. The peasant knew to not take such things lightly so he whipped his horse, wanting to quickly pass by the place.The horse refused to advance a single step forwards. It reared up as though it were standing before a ditch.The peasant was now in grave danger. He sat there with his hair standing on end, shivering in fear. What could he do? He climbed down from the sled to see what was the matter. There was no ditch crossing the route, but rather an open pit.Now what?The peasant would have driven around the pit, but he discovered deep water on both sides. Looking around, he saw that the blue light had flamed up as large as a pitch torch. Suddenly a second and a third fire rose up, and then many, many fires were dancing across the moor."Father, son, and holy ghost! What is happening here tonight?" he called out.Hardly had he said these words when his horse jumped ahead as though it had been stuck with a needle. The peasant was barely able to jump back onto the sled, and away he sped in a furious galop.It is fortunate that the peasant was able to utter the name of God just in time.
