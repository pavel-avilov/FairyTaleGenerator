There was a certain old man which let his son to marry, and to bring his wife and his children to dwell with him, and to take all the house into his own hand and guiding. so a certain time the old man was set, and kept the upper end of the table. afterwards they set him lower, about the middle of the table. thirdly, they set him at the nether end of the table. fourthly, he was set among the servants. fifthly, they made him a couch behind the hall door, and cast on him an old sackcloth.Not long after, the old man died. when he was dead, the young man's son came to him, and said, "father, I pray you give me this old sackcloth that was wont to cover my grand father.""What wouldst thou do with it?" said his father."Forsooth," said the child, "it shall serve to cover you when ye be old, like as it did my grandfather."At which words of the child this man ought to have been ashamed and sorry. for it is written, "son, reverence and help thy father in his old age, and make him not thoughtful and heavy in his life, and though he dotes, forgive him. he that honoureth his father shall live the longer, and shall rejoice in his own children."
