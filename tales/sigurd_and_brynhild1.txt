Then Sigurd rode on till he found a house on the mountain, wherein a woman in a helmet and coat of chainmail lay sleeping. He drew his sword and cut the chainmail from her. She awoke then, and gave her name as Hild. she is called Brynhild, and was a Valkyrie.Sigurd rode away and came to the king who was named Gjuki, whose wife was Grimhild. their children were Gunnar, Hogni, Gudrun, Gudny. Gotthorm was Gjuki's stepson. Sigurd tarried there a long time, and then he obtained the hand of Gudrun, daughter of Gjuki, and Gunnar and Hogni swore oaths of blood brotherhood with Sigurd.Thereafter Sigurd and the sons of Gjuki went unto Atli (Attila the Hun), Budli's son, to sue for the hand of Brynhild his sister in marriage to Gunnar. Brynhild abode on Hinda Fell, and about her hall there was a flaring fire. and she had made a solemn vow to take none but that man who should dare to ride through the flaring fire.Then Sigurd and the sons of Gjuki (who were also called Niflungs) rode up onto the mountain, and Gunnar should have ridden through the flaring fire. but he had the horse named Goti, and that horse dared not leap into the fire. So they exchanged shapes, Sigurd and Gunnar, and names likewise. for Grani would go under no man but Sigurd.Then Sigurd leapt onto Grani and rode through the flaring fire. That eve he was wedded with Brynhild. But when they came to bed, he drew the Sword Gram from its sheath and laid it between them. In the morning when he arose and clothed himself, he gave Brynhild as linen fee the same gold ring which Loki had taken from Andvari, and took another ring from her hand for remembrance.Then Sigurd mounted his horse and rode to his fellows, and he and Gunnar changed shapes again and went home to Gjuki with Brynhild. Sigurd and Gudrun had two children, Sigmund and Svanhild.It befell on a time that Brynhild and Gudrun went to the water to wash their hair. And when they came to the river, Brynhild waded out from the bank well into the river, saying that she would not touch to her head the water which ran out of the hair of Gudrun, since herself had the more valorous husband.Then Gudrun went into the river after her and said that it was her right to wash her hair higher upstream, for the reason that she had to husband such a man as neither Gunnar nor any other in the world matched in valor, seeing that he had slain Fafnir and Regin and succeeded to the heritage of both.And Brynhild made answer: "It was a matter of greater worth that Gunnar rode through the flaring fire and Sigurd durst not."Then Gudrun laughed, and said: "Dost thou think that Gunnar rode through the flaring fire? Now I think that he who went into the bride bed with thee was the same that gave me this gold ring. and the gold ring which thou bearest on thine hand and didst receive for linen fee is called Andvari's Yield , and I believe that it was not Gunnar who got that ring on Gnita Heath."Then Brynhild was silent, and went home.After that she egged on Gunnar and Hogni to slay Sigurd. but because they were Sigurd's sworn blood brothers, they stirred up Gotthorm their brother to slay him. He thrust his sword through Sigurd as he slept. but when Sigurd felt the wound, he hurled his sword Gram after Gotthorm, so that it cut the man asunder at the middle. There fell Sigurd and Sigmund, his son of three winters, whom they slew.Then Brynhild stabbed herself with a sword, and she was burned with Sigurd. but Gunnar and Hogni took Fafnir's heritage and Andvari's Yield, and ruled the lands thereafter.Atli Marries GudrunKing Atli, Budli's son, and brother of Brynhild, then wedded Gudrun, whom Sigurd had had to wife. and they had children. King Atli invited to him Gunnar and Hogni, and they came at his invitation. Yet before they departed from their land, they hid the gold, Fafnir's heritage, in the Rhine, and that gold has never since been found.Now King Atli had a host in readiness, and fought with Gunnar and Hogni. and they were made captive. King Atli bade the heart be cut out of Hogni alive, and that was his end. Gunnar he caused to be cast into a den of serpents. But a harp was brought secretly to Gunnar, and he struck it with his toes, his hands being bound. he played the harp so that all the serpents fell asleep, saving only one adder, which glided over to him and gnawed into the cartilage of his breastbone so far that her head sank within the wound, and she clove to his liver till he died.Gunnar and Hogni were called Niflungs and Gjukungs, for which reason gold is called Treasure, or Heritage, of the Niflungs .A little while after, Gudrun slew her two sons, and caused flagons to be made of their skulls, set with gold and silver. Then the funeral feast was held for the Niflungs. and at this feast Gudrun had mead poured into the flagons for King Atli, and the mead was mixed with the blood of the boys. Moreover, she caused their hearts to be roasted and set before the king, that he might eat of them. And when he had eaten, then she herself told him what she had done, with many scathing words.There was no lack of strong drink there, so that most of the company had fallen asleep where they sat. That night she went to the king while he slept, and Hogni's son with her. they smote the king, and that was the death of him. Then they set fire to the hall, and burned the folk that were within.After that she went to the shore and leaped into the sea, desiring to make an end of herself. but she was tossed by the billows over the firth, and was borne to King Jonak's land. And when he saw her, he took her to him and wedded her, and they had three sons, called Sorli, Hamdir, and Erp. they were all raven black of hair, like Gunnar and Hogni and the other Niflungs.
