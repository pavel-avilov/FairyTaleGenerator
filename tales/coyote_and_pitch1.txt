One day Coyote heard that Pitch, the bad man, was coming. He went out to meet him, and said, "I can whip you, no matter who you are."Pitch answered, "I can't fight with my hands."Thereupon Coyote struck him with his fist. but the fist stuck fast.Then Coyote said, "If I strike you with my left hand, I'll kill you.""Go ahead, do it!" answered Pitch.Coyote hit him, and his left hand stuck fast."I'll kick you," said Coyote. and Pitch replied, "All right, kick!"Coyote kicked, and his foot stuck fast."If I kick you with my left foot," threatened Coyote, "I'll surely kill you.""Do it!" mocked Pitch.Coyote kicked again, and his left foot stuck fast."I will lash you with my tail!" shouted Coyote, whereupon his tail stuck fast.Then Coyote became angry, and threatened to kill Pitch with his ear. but his ear, too, stuck fast. Finally Coyote hit him with his head. The same thing happened. His head stuck fast. Now Coyote was stuck to Pitch, and could not pry himself loose.After a while his friend Spider came there, and saw Coyote's predicament. "How can I help you?" inquired he."Cut my hand away, but do not cut it," said Coyote."It will be easier to burn it away," suggested Spider."No!" said Coyote, "scrape it away!"Spider did so, and after a while Coyote became free.
