One day when a monkey was climbing a tree in the forest in which helived, he ran a thorn into his tail. Try as he would, he could not get itout, so he went to a barber in the town and said, "Friend barber, I have athorn in the end of my tail. Pull it out, and I will pay you well."The barber tried to pull out the thorn with his razor, but in doing sohe cut off the end of the tail.The monkey was very angry and cried, "Barber, barber, give me back mytail, or give me your razor!"The barber could not put back the end of the monkey's tail, so he gavehim his razor.On the way home the monkey met an old woman who was cutting wood forfuel, and he said to her, "Grandmother, grandmother, that is very hard.Use this razor and then it will cut easily."The old woman was very pleased with the offer and began to cut with therazor, but before she had used it long it broke.Then the monkey cried, "Grandmother, grandmother, you have broken myrazor! You must get a new one for me or else give me all thefirewood."The old woman could not get a new razor, so she gave him thefirewood.The monkey took the wood and was going back to town to sell it, when hesaw a woman sitting beside the road making cakes."Grandmother, grandmother," said he, "your wood is most gone. Take thisof mine and bake more cakes."The woman took the wood and thanked him for his kindness, but when thelast stick was burned, the monkey cried out, "Grandmother, grandmother,you have burned up all my wood! Now you must give me all your cakes to payfor it."The old woman could not cut more dry wood at once, so she gave him allthe cakes. The monkey took the cakes and the town, but on the way he met adog which bit him so that he died. And the dog ate all the cakes.
