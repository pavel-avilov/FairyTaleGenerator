There was a certain bald man with a head like a copper pot. Once on a time a young man, who, being hungry, had gathered wood apples, as he was coming along his path, saw him sitting at the foot of a tree. In fun he hit him. on the head with a wood apple. the bald man took it patiently and said nothing to him. Then he hit his head with all the rest of the wood apples that he had, throwing them at him one after another, and the bald man remained silent, even though the blood flowed.So the foolish young fellow had to go home hungry without his wood apples, which he had broken to pieces in his useless and childish pastime of pelting the bald man. and the foolish bald man went home with his head streaming with blood, saying to himself. "Why should I not submit to being pelted with such delicious wood apples?"And everybody there laughed, when they saw him with his head covered with blood, looking like the diadem with which he had been crowned king of fools.Thus you see that foolish persons become the objects of ridicule in the world, and do not succeed in their objects. but wise persons are honoured.
