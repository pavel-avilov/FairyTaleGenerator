How Vulcan once espied his wifeEngaged with Mars in amorous strife.When cunningly he threw a snareAround the fond but guilty pair.Whene'er Dan Vulcan, dunderhead,Had spied the amorous twain in bed,Around the couch a net he threw(Which was an foolish thing to do.For little wotteth he of lifeWho thinks he only hath his wife),And then the gods did he convoke,Who crowded round with gibe and joke,Beholding how the pair were ta'en.But many 'mong the host, with pain,Beheld dame Venus' sore distress,While marveling at her loveliness.Nor heard unmoved her bitter criesAt suffering such indignitiesBefore her peers in open day.Yet 'twas no marvel, one would say,That Venus unto Mars should give menHerself   for could she care to liveWith Vulcan, black from head to foot,Hands, face, and throat begrimed with soot?Such things in Venus' breast must rouseDisgust, though Vulcan were her spouse.Nay, even though she had been pairedWith Absalom the golden haired,Or lovely Paris, Priam's son,She scarce had been content with one,For ever would that beauteous queenDo what all women love I ween.Women as free as men are born.It is the law alone hath tornTheir charter, and that freedom rivenFrom out their hands by Nature given.For Nature is not such a foolAs order, by unbending rule,Margot to keep to Robichon,Nor yet for him the only oneTo be Marie or fair Perrette,Jane, Agnes, or sweet Mariette,But as, dear son, I scarce need teach,Made each for all and all for each,And every one for all alike,E'en as the taste and fancy strike.So that (although by marriage lawThey are assigned like things of straw),To satisfy Dame Nature's call,To which they hearken one and all,And strifes and murders to avoid,Whereto they well might be decoyed,Ever have women, foul or fair,Whether the name of maid they bear,Or wife, done all within their powerTo win back freedom as their dower.Though at great hazards they maintainTheir rights, and evils thick as rainHave happed both now and formerly.Ten, nay, a hundred easily,Could I of instances set forth.But let them pass as nowise worthMy pains to tell or yours to hear,You'd weary ere the end came near....Therefore, dear son, should we be slowVenus and Mars to blame, I trow.And though the Gods in mockery laughedTo see the pair by Vulcan's craftEnsnared, yet many a one full fainHad been, could he the place have ta'enOf Mars, in Venus' fond embrace,While Vulcan, mad with his disgrace,Two thousand marks had rather givenThan cuckold stand before high heaven.The pair he thus exposed to shame,Reckless of scorn henceforth became,And boldly practiced that which theyStrove erst to hide from light of day,Shame and decorum cast aside.And then the Gods told far and wideThe tale, till all through heaven 'twas known,From mouth to mouth mid laughter thrown.And Vulcan stormed with rage to thinkThe draught he brewed he needs must drink,Since for his folly naught could heFind balsam, salve, or remedy.Rather than trap the twain, indeed,'Twere wiser to have given no heed,But silently resolve in mindTo be to Venus' failings blind,So long as she towards him behavedWith kindness, granting all he craved.From this, let no man e'er forgetThat grievous folly 'tis to setA trap whereby a wife may beConvicted of inconstancy.For if she find her thus exposed,The door of virtue feels she closedBehind her, and the unhappy wretch,Whom evil eyed suspicions stretchUpon the rack, when he hath caughtHis wife, shall ne'er again know aughtOf peace or happiness, but dieThe prey of cruel Jealousy.
