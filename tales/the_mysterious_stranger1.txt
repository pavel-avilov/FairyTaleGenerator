Anno 165_.At _ _in the Moorlands in Staffordshire, lived a poor old man, who had been a long time lame. One Sunday, in the afternoon, he being alone, one knocked at his door. he bade him open it, and come in.The stranger desired a cup of beer. the lame man desired him to take a dish and draw some, for he was not able to do it himself. The stranger asked the poor old man how long he had been ill.The poor man told him.Said the stranger, "I can cure you. Take two or three balm leaves steeped in your beer for a fortnight or three weeks, and you will be restored to your health. but constantly and zealously serve God."The poor man did so, and became perfectly well.This stranger was in a purple shag gown, such as was not seen or known in those parts. And nobody in the street after evensong did see any one in such a colored habit.Doctor Gilbert Sheldon, since Archbishop of Canterbury, was then in the Moorlands, and justified the truth of this to Elias Ashmole, Esq., from whom I had this account, and he hath inserted it in some of his memoirs, which are in the (Ashmolean) Museum at Oxford.
