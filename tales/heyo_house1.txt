One day whiles ole Miss Rabbit en de little Rabs is out pickin' sallid fer dinner, he (Brer Wolf) went in de house, he did, en wait fer Brer Rabbit ter come home. Brer Rabbit had his hours, en dis wuz one un um, en't wan't long 'fo' here he come. He got a mighty quick eye, mon, en he tuck notice dat ev'ything mighty still. When he got little nigher, he tuck notice dat de front door wuz on de crack, en dis make 'im feel funny, kaze he know dat when his ole 'oman en de chillun out, dey allers pulls de door shet en ketch de latch. So he went up a little nigher, en he step thin ez a battercake. He peep here, en he peep dar, yit he ain't see nothin'. He lissen in de chimbley cornder, en he lissen und' de winder, yit he ain't hear nothin'.Den he sorter wipe his mustach en study. He 'low ter hisse'f, "De pot rack know what gwine on up de chimbley, de rafters know who's in de loft, de bed cord know who und' de bed. I ain't no pot rack, I ain't no rafter, en I ain't no bed cord, but, please gracious! I 'm gwine ter fin' who's in dat house, en I ain't gwine in dar nudder. Dey mo' ways ter fin' out who fell in de mill pond widout fallin' in yo'se'f.""Some folks," Uncle Remus went on, "would 'a' rushed in dar, en ef dey had, dey would n't 'a' rushed out no mo', kaze dey wouldn't 'a' been nothin' 't all lef un um but a little scrap er hide en a han'ful er ha'r."Brer Rabbit got better sense dan dat. All he ax anybody is ter des gi' 'im han' roomance, en dem what kin ketch 'im is mo' dan welly come ter take 'im. Dat 'zackly de kinder man what Brer Rabbit is.He went off a little ways fum de house en clum a 'simmon stump en got up dar en 'gun ter holler, "He'low, Heyo, house!"De house ain't make no answer, en Brer Wolf, in dar behime de door, open his eyes wide. He ain't know what ter make er dat kinder doin's.Brer Rabbit holler, "Heyo, house! Why n't you heyo?"House ain't make no answer, en Brer Wolf in dar behime de door sorter move roun' like he gittin' restless in de min'.Brer Rabbit out dar on de 'simmon stump holler mo' louder dan befo', "Heyo, house! Heyo!"House stan' still, en Brer Wolf in dar behime de door 'gun ter feel col' chills streakin' up and down his back. In all his born days he ain't never hear no gwines on like dat. He peep thoo de crack er de door, but he can't see nothin'.Brer Rabbit holler louder, "Heyo, house! Ain't you gwine ter heyo? Is you done los' what little manners you had?"Brer Wolf move 'bout wuss'n befo'. He feel des like some un done hit 'im on de funny bone.Brer Rabbit holler hard ez he kin, but still he ain't git no answer, en den he 'low, "Sholy sump'n nudder is de matter wid dat house, kaze all de times befo' dis, it been holler'n back at me, 'Heyo, yo'se'f!'"Den Brer Rabbit wait little bit, en bimeby he holler one mo' time, "Heyo, house!"Ole Brer Wolf try ter talk like he speck a house 'ud talk, en he holler back, "Heyo, yo'se'f!"Brer Rabbit wunk at hisse'f. He low, "Heyo, house! why n't you talk hoarse like you got a bad col'?"Den Brer Wolf holler back, hoarse ez he kin, "Heyo, yo'se'f!"Dis make Brer Rabbit laugh twel a little mo' en he 'd a drapt off'n dat ar 'simmon stump en hurt hisse'f.He 'low, "Eh eh, Brer Wolf! dat ain't nigh gwine ter do. You 'll hatter stan' out in de rain a mighty long time 'fo' you kin talk hoarse ez dat house!""I let you know," continued Uncle Remus, laying his hand gently on the little boy's shoulder, "I let you know, Brer Wolf come a slinkin' out, en made a break fer home. Atter dat, Brer Rabbit live a long time wid'out any er de yuther creeturs a pesterin un 'im!"
