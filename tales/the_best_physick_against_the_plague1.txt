It is my opinion, and I must leave it as a prescription, ( viz. ) that the best physick against the plague is to run away from it. I know people encourage themselves by saying, God is able to keep us in the midst of danger, and able to overtake us when we think ourselves out of danger. and this kept thousands in the town, whose carcases went into the great pits by cartloads. and who, if they had fled from the danger, had, I believe, been safe from the disaster. at least 'tis probable they had been safe.And were this very fundamental only duly considered by the people on any future occasion of this, or the like nature, I am persuaded it would put them upon quite different measures for managing the people from those that they took in 1665, or than any that have been taken abroad, that I have heard of. in a word, they would consider of separating the people into smaller bodies, and removing them in time farther from one another, and not let such a contagion as this, which is indeed chiefly dangerous to collected bodies of people, find a million of people in a body together, as was very near the case before, and would certainly be the case if it should ever appear again.The plague, like a great fire, if a few houses only are contiguous where it happens, can only burn a few houses. or if it begins in a single, or as we call it, a lone house, can only burn that lone house where it begins. But if it begins in a close built town or city, and gets ahead, there its fury increases, it rages over the whole place, and consumes all it can reach.
