If someone plows away land from his neighbor, then after his death he appears every night as a fiery skeleton on the stolen land. And if one looks out a window at midnight, the skeleton will come up to the eaves, just wanting to be spoken to, for then he would be redeemed.In this regard they tell about the following event in Siggenthal:One night around midnight a traveling tailor was at work in a customer's house when his light went out. A fiery skeleton was standing just outside the window, and it moaned over and over again: "A hoe! A hoe!"The tailor wisely did not answer, but instead called the household together and asked them to give the skeleton what he wanted. They fetched a hoe and threw it out the window. The next morning they found it lying outside. The hoe's handle was badly burned, and the iron was still glowing.
