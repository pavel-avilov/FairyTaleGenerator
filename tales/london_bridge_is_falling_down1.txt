London Bridge is falling down, etc.,My fair lady!How shall we build it up again?  Build it up with lime and stone.  Stone and lime would wash away.  Build it up with iron bars.  Iron bars would bend and break.  Build it up with gold and silver.  Gold and silver would be stole away.  Get a watch to watch all night.  Suppose the watch should fall asleep?  Get him a pipe to smoke all night.  Suppose the pipe should fall and break?  Get a dog to bark all night.  Suppose the dog should get a bone?  Get a cock to crow all night.  Suppose the cock should fly away?  What has this poor prisoner done?  He's broke my box and stole my keys.  A hundred pounds will set him free.  A hundred pounds he has not got.  Off to prison he must go.  My fair lady!
