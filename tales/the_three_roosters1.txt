We read about three roosters that crowed in the night while the lady of the house was lying with an adulterer. Now the kitchen maid understood the language of birds.The first night the one rooster crowed, "My mistress is unfaithful to my master."The kitchen maid reported this to the lady of the house. The woman said, "That rooster must die," and the rooster was broiled.The next night the second rooster sang, and when the kitchen maid was asked about it, she said that the rooster had crowed, "My companion died for telling the truth."Then the lady of the house said, "He too shall die," and this rooster was immediately broiled.The next time the woman went to bed with her lover, the third rooster crowed, as interpreted by the kitchen maid, "See, hear, and remain silent, if you want to live in peace."Audi, vive, tace,Se vis vivere in pace.
