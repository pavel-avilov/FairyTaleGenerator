There was an old man who lived in a wood,As you may plainly see,He said he could work more in a day,Than his wife could do in three."If that be the case," the old woman said,"If that be the case," said she,"The you shall stay at home today,And I'll go and drive the plow.But mind you, milk the cherry cow,For fear that she'd go dry,And mind you, tend the suckling pigsThat lie in yonder sty.And mind you, watch the speckled hen,For fear that she would stray,And mind you, wind the worsted yarn,That I spun yesterday."The old woman took the whip in hand,And went to drive the plow.The old man took the milking pail,And went to milk the cow.But Cherry, she kicked, and Cherry, she flung,And Cherry, she wouldn't be quiet,She gave the old man a kick in the leg,Which made him kick up a riot.He went to watch the speckled hen,For fear that she should stray,But he forgot to wind the yarnHis wife spun yesterday.Then he swore by the sun, the moon, and the stars,And all that was in heaven,That his wife could do more work in a day,Than he could do in seven.
