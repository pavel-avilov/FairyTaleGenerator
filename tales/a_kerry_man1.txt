There was a Kerry man once who heard of a pot of gold that was in Dublin. He went to Dublin and began to search. He was searching for a week, when a man that was working near the place, asked him what he was doing. He said he was searching for a pot of gold.The Dublin man told him that he was a foolish man, and to go home. For he heard of a pot of gold in Kerry, in the corner of a haggard (haystack enclosure) under an apple tree. The Kerry man found out that it was his own haggard, and he went home and opened a hole under the tree and got a pot of gold.John Fitzgerald.Ballygiltenan, Glin.Co.
