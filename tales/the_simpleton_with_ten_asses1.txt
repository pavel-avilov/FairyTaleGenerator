A simpleton, who was a servant, had ten asses which he hired to certain people, and when they came back to their places he took his asses and counted them, and found them to be ten. Then he mounted one of them and rode some distance and came back, and as he was going away he counted those that were before him, and found them to be nine. and he was angry, and alighted and counted them over again, and found them to be ten. And he mounted an ass again, and counted the others and found them to be nine. thereupon he dismounted and counted them, and found them to be ten.Then he said, "Verily there is a devil with me, for whenever I mount an ass I lose one of them. therefore I must not ride lest I lose one altogether."Thus he traveled over the whole country on foot, for he dared not mount one of them.
