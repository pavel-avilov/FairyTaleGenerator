One day a country mouse in his poor homeReceived an ancient friend, a mouse from Rome:The host, though close and careful, to a guestCould open still, so now he did his best.He spares not oats or vetches: in his chapsRaisins he brings and nibbled bacon scraps,Hoping by varied dainties to enticeHis town bred guest, so delicate and nice,Who condescended graciously to touchThing after thing, but never would take much,While he, the owner of the mansion, sateOn threshed out straw, and spelt and darnels ate.At length the townsman cries: "I wonder howYou can live here, friend, on this hill's rough brow:Take my advice, and leave these ups and downs,This hill and dale, for humankind and towns.Come now, go home with me: remember, allWho live on earth are mortal, great and small:Then take, good sir, your pleasure while you may.With life so short, 'twere wrong to lose a day."This reasoning made the rustic's head turn round.Forth from his hole he issues with a bound,And they two make together for their mark,In hopes to reach the city during dark.The midnight sky was bending over all,When they set foot within a stately hall,Where couches of wrought ivory had been spreadWith gorgeous coverlets of Tyrian red,And viands piled up high in baskets lay,The relics of a feast of yesterday.The townsman does the honours, lays his guestAt ease upon a couch with crimson dressed,Then nimbly moves in character of host,And offers in succession boiled and roast.Nay, like a well trained slave, each wish prevents,And tastes before the tit bits he presents.The guest, rejoicing in his altered fare,Assumes in turn a genial diner's air,When hark! a sudden banging of the door:Each from his couch is tumbled on the floor:Half dead, they scurry round the room, poor things,While the whole house with barking mastiffs rings.Then says the rustic: "It may do for you,This life, but I don't like it. so adieu:Give me my hole, secure from all alarms,I'll prove that tares and vetches still have charms.
