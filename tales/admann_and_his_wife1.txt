Admann sends his wife out to weed the flax. In the field she asks herself the question, "Should I weed or should I eat?" and decides to do the latter. Then, having refreshed herself with food and drink she asks, "Should I weed or should I sleep?" and once again decides to do the latter. Thus it continues day in and day out.Then one day her husband follows her, and when he discovers her asleep, he cuts off her long skirts.Awakening, she bewilderedly asks herself, "Is this me, or not?"Finally she goes to her house in order to convince herself, knocks on the window, and asks, "Admann, is your wife at home?"When he answers, "yes," she replies, "Then it's not me," and walks away, never to be seen again.
