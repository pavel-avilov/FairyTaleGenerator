A ghostly spirit in the form of a man is frequently seen in the fields surrounding Eger. The people call him "Squire Ludwig." It is said that a man by this name formerly lived here, and that he deceitfully moved the field's boundary stones. Soon after his death he began to wander about, appearing to many people and frightening them.This was experienced in more recent times by a girl from the town. One day she walked through the town gate by herself and happened into the infamous area. At the place where the boundary stone had been moved to (as was claimed), a man approached her. He had the appearance of the evil squire, as he had been described. He walked toward her, took hold of her breast with his fist, and then disappeared.She ran home in shock, and said to her family, "I'm done for!"They saw that her breast had turned black where the spirit had grabbed her. She immediately went to bed, and on the third day afterward she died.
