Excerpt from a letter by Richard Harris Barham to Mrs. Hughes, July 19, 1832:I am sorry to say, from letters received from town this morning, that this horrible plague continues its ravages on the city. Of Dr. Davies's eight patients, four died the same day with my poor boy, and the others since. and I learn that twelve are now lying dead in the immediate neighbourhood of St. Paul's Churchyard.In the meantime Government are using all their influence with the Press to make as light as possible of the business, in order to prevent the necessity of declaring London a foul port.
