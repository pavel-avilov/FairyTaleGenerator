A man of infamous character, one night told his wife to make haste and get supper ready. she accordingly brought to table some dry stale bread."Why my dear," said he, "who the devil can eat such dry, hard bread as that?""Get up and moisten it," said she."No, do you," returned the husband."I'll be hanged if I do," replied the wife." I'm fatigued, and won't stir an inch."Thus they went on, each growing more and more obstinate, till at length it was determined by the consent of both, that whoever should speak the ?rs word, should instantly get up and moisten the bread. In this interesting situation they remained for a considerable time, when one of the neighbors accidentally came in, who had a sneaking attachment to the lady. They both looked at him attentively, but said nothing."Good evening," said the visitor.They said nothing."What's the matter," continued he. Why are you silent?"They said nothing. Whence he conjectured that they had laid a wager to preserve silence."You are a man," said he to the husband. Why don't you speak?"He said nothing.He kissed his wife, but the man said nothing. He disgraced her, but the man said nothing. His facetious neighbor gave him a blow on the cheek, but the man said nothing.Irritated, he at length went to the justice and complained that he could, not make the man speak.He was committed to prison. Still he said nothing. The next morning he was again brought before the judge, but still said nothing. The judge ordered him to be hanged for contumacy.When the sentence was on the point of being executed, the wife appeared, and in a most pitiable tone exclaimed, " Alas my unfortunate husband!""You devil," said he, "go home and moisten the bread."
