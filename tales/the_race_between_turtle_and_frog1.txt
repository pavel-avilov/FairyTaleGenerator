At one time there was a race proposed between Turtle and Frog. All the people bet that Frog would win. Mud Turtle asked for three days to let his friends know about the race. The race course was very uneven: low and high ground, rolling meadow.Turtle bet his back against Frog's tail.On the third day Turtle was given head start. Frog stood there taking more bets. Finally he started, and ahead in a low place he saw Turtle going out of sight. Each time he looked ahead he saw Turtle going out of sight. He hurried faster and faster, but did not overtake him. Just as he crossed the last low ground he saw Turtle over the line. He had to give up his tail. It took six turtles to beat him, but he lost the race. Now the pollywogs have to lose their tails before they can become frogs.
