A long time ago this happened where my father was working. The man's name was Mr. Keating of Ardnaveagh, Ardbohill not far from Keen's Pike. This farmer often dreamt that a crock of gold was hidden in his land, but he would not believe it.This time he had a dream and it continued for three nights in succession, that there was a crock of gold for him at the Draws Bridge outside Limerick. He started at four o'clock in the morning, when he arrived there, to his surprise the first person he met was a man coming towards him. He stopped to speak to him.Mr. Keating asked the stranger where he was going.He told him he had a dream that there was a crock of gold at Mr. Keatings of Ardnaveagh, and he came to find it. Would you tell me where the place is.Mr. Keating did not give him any account for he knew it was his own place he was talking about. He hurried home to dig for the gold himself and found it in his own haggard (haystack enclosure) under a white thorn bush.He never saw the man he met at Draws Bridge afterward.Written by Patrick Kelly.Told to him by James Kelly,Gortroe,Rathkeale.
