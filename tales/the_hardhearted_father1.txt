"Crippled Simon," a cobbler at Signa near Reit or Rattenberg, is still alive. His feet are terribly twisted, and he can only walk very slowly with his cane.His father was an evil tempered laborer who was fond of drinking. When Simon was approaching his fourth year he was a lively healthy child. Once when his father came home late, the child was crying and would not fall asleep. The father shouted at the boy to be still, but this only frightened the youngster, and he cried even louder. The father became so angry that he threatened the child with the devil, calling him the devil's rascal.Finally he ripped open the window and held the boy out in the cold night, shouting, "The devil can take him, because he won't be still!"Outside it howled like a fierce storm. The mother began to cry and tremble, and when the window began to rattle the father took fright as well. He pulled the child back in, but the boy's feet were twisted out of shape, and he was now quite still, as though dead. From that time onward the boy suffered from cramps, lameness, and tremors.He is now 46 years old, and he remains a cripple.The father suffered from a bad conscience until he himself died. Others always accused him of his son's misfortune.Everyone who hears or reads this account will understand what the moral of the story is.
