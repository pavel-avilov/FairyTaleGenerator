We read in a chronicle that there was once a city, whose name I have forgotten, that was captured after a long seige. Now the lord who had captured the city was so angry that he gave only the women freedom to leave, carrying whatever they wanted, after which he intended to burn the city with everything in it. The good women were beside themselves with sorrow that their husbands and children were to be burned alive. Therefore they took counsel with one another and decided that each woman would take her husband and children onto her back and carry them outside the city.They did just that. each woman took her husband onto her back and her children under her arms and carried them outside the city.Now the chronicle tells us that when the conquering lord saw this tears came to his eyes, and he spared the lives of everyone and set the city free as well.This is a wonderful example of women showing great virtue and practicing friendship toward their husbands. What did they achieve with this? This is what they achieved: All lives were spared, and not only were their lives spared, but all their possessions were restored to them undamaged. This is a good example of the faithfulness that all women owe their husbands.
