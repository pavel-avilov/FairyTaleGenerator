When the Festival of Saint Mary of the Snows was first celebrated in Schleid nearly everyone from Motzlar went there to participate.Only a single peasant from the village remained behind, saying mockingly, "I'll not go to the Snow Festival," then went to his field to plow.But things did not go well for him. When the others returned from the festival they heard him moaning and crying, "If I only had gone to the festival with you!"Afterward when his people entered his house they found him lying dead on the floor, black over his entire body. He was the last person in Motzlar to die from the plague.
