The Eternal Jew was once seen on a cloudy day in the Schildbach Forest. He was tall and sinister looking with an ice gray beard and hair. He was wrapped in a grayish brown, tattered cloak which almost covered his sinister looking and deeply furrowed face. With a rough and foreign sounding voice he asked an old birdcatcher about this and that: about families and villages that were no longer there, but that according to legend had existed in earlier centuries.Then he pointed out some unknown qualities of birds that were hanging there, as well as some healing herbs that grew just outside of the forest hut. With all this, however, he kept a good distance from the crossbill finch.The old birdcatcher grew uneasy about his guest. When he asked how a good Christian could know all of these things, the stranger stood up and walked away without saying anything.Looking after the departing stranger, the birdcatcher noticed from his tracks that each of his soles was imbedded with five large headed nails forming the shape of a cross. Thus with every step the wanderer struck this holy symbol into the ground. Then the birdcatcher knew who this ancient wanderer was, and how he knew all about the region from many centuries ago.
