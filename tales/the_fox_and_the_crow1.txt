A crow was sitting on a branch of a tree with a piece of cheese in herbeak when a fox observed her and set his wits to work to discover some wayof getting the cheese. Coming and standing under the tree he looked upand said, "What a noble bird I see above me! Her beauty is without equal,the hue of her plumage exquisite. If only her voice is as sweet as herlooks are fair, she ought without doubt to be queen of the birds." Thecrow was hugely flattered by this, and just to show the fox that she couldsing she gave a loud caw. Down came the cheese, of course, and the fox,snatching it up, said, "You have a voice, madam, I see. What you want iswits."
