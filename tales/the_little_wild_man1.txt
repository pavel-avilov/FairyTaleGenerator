Ruzo, the first peasant at Rofen, had a very beautiful little daughter. The girl herded her father's sheep up in the mountains. Often when she was sitting there by herself a poorly dressed little man came to her from a nearby mountain. No one in the valley knew who he was or where he came from.The little fellow would sit by her side and tell her all kinds of curious stories. or he would help her with the herding and bring a lost sheep back to her. He often asked her to go to his house with him, but to no avail, for she was very modest and did not trust her unknown visitor.The little man sometimes came to the girl's father at Rofen, and whenever he did so, he asked for food.Some years later Ruzo's daughter had become a beautiful young woman. She married one of her father's former herders, and they settled in Vent.The little man missed the girl, and he learned from a herder boy that she had married and moved to Vent. Hearing this he became wild with anger. Repeatedly he frightend the Rofen peasant's herd such that in the evening the poor sheep would return to the stall bleating and hungry. During the night the angry little man would untie one cow but then bind two or three others together such that they mooed loudly and nearly broke apart their bonds. He set the hay afire and laughed cruely at the rising flames.Ruzo tried to capture him, sending his servants after him, but without success. The little man always escaped unhurt. In order to put an end to the angry little fellow's mischief, Ruzo's daughter herself went back out with the herd. Wanting to placate the little man, she brought with her a new suit made of loden for him.He approached her friendlily. However, as soon as he saw the gift he walked away crying, and returned to his mountain.From that hour onward he was never seen again. Ruzo believed that the little man had died, and he named the mountain "Wildes Mannle" (Little Wild Man), and so it is called to this day.
