According to the well known legend, it was the Jews who caused the black death by poisoning and infecting the wells, thus bringing the plague to Christendom. It was said that relatively fewer Jews died from the plague. Everywhere they were persecuted, arrested, tortured, and burned to death by the thousand.Although the black death did not come to Strasbourg until the summer of 1349, already one year earlier the city council was pressured from various sides to attack the Jews living in the city with fire and sword. Enemies of the Jews felt that these attacks were too lenient. The community's uproar brought about a change in the city government. Under the administration of the new council, on February 14, Saint Valentine's Day, 1349, two thousand Jews were burned to death in their own cemetery near the northern boundary of the city.The plague broke out in Strasbourg on Saint John's day (June 24) of the same year.The street in which the Jews were burned to death is still today (1852) named Brandgasse (Fire Alley).
