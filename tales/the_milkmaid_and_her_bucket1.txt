A senator fell to musing as follows: "With the money which I shall get for my vote in favour of the bill to subsidise cat ranches, I can buy a kit of burglar's tools and open a bank. The profit of that enterprise will enable me to obtain a long, low, black schooner, raise a death's head flag and engage in commerce on the high seas. From my gains in that business I can pay for the presidency, which at $50,000 a year will give me in four years  " but it took him so long to make the calculation that the bill to subsidise cat ranches passed without his vote, and he was compelled to return to his constituents an honest man, tormented with a clean conscience.
