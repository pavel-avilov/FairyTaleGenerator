There was a woman who had a magpie in a cage, and it would tell tales about what it saw people do. It happened that the husband kept a large eel in a little pond in his garden, with the intention of feeding it to friends when they came to visit him.However, once when the husband was out the wife said to her maid, "Let us eat the large eel, and we will tell my husband that the otter ate it."When the husband came home the magpie told him how the wife had eaten the eel.He went to the pond, but could not find the eel. He then asked his wife what had become of the eel. She tried to make an excuse for herself, but he said, "Don't make excuses, because I know that you have eaten it, for the magpie told me so."Then he scolded his wife severely for eating the eel.After the husband left the wife and her maid went to the magpie and plucked out all the feathers on its head, saying, "This is for telling on us about the eel." Thus the poor magpie had its head feathers plucked out.From that time forth whenever the magie saw a bald man, or a woman with a high forehead, it would say, "You must have told about the eel."
