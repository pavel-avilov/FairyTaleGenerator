"The name Lepracaun ," Mr. Douglas Hyde writes to me, "is from the Irish leith brog   i.e. , the One shoemaker, since he is generally seen working at a single shoe. It is spelt in Irish leith bhrogan , or leith phrogan , and is in some places pronounced Luchryman, as O' Kearney writes it in that very rare book, the Feis Tigh Chonain ."The Lepracaun , Cluricaun , and Far Darrig . Are these one spirit in different moods and shapes? Hardly two Irish writers are agreed. In many things these three fairies, if three, resemble each other. They are withered, old, and solitary, in every way unlike the sociable spirits of the first sections. They dress with all unfairy homeliness, and are, indeed, most sluttish, slouching, jeering, mischievous phantoms. They are the great practical jokers among the good people.The Lepracaun makes shoes continually, and has grown very rich. Many treasure crocks, buried of old in war time, has he now for his own. In the early part of this century, according to Croker, in a newspaper office in Tipperary, they used to show a little shoe forgotten by a Lepracaun.The Cluricaun , ( Clobhair ceann , in O'Kearney) makes himself drunk in gentlemen's cellars. Some suppose he is merely the Lepracaun on a spree. He is almost unknown in Connaught and the north.The Far Darrig ( fear dearg ), which means the Red Man, for he wears a red cap and coat, busies himself with practical joking, especially with gruesome joking. This he does, and nothing else.
