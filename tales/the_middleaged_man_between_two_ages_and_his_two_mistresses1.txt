A man advanced in life,And getting into grey,Thought it high time in his decayTo dream about a wife.He had enough in cash and houses,Therefore a choice of charming spouses.All strove to please him, Some too did tease him.On which our lover checked his new propension,No trifle was success in his intention.Two widows o'er his heart did most prevail.The one still fresh, the other rather stale.But she by pretty arts repaidWhat nature in her had decayed.They smiled, they joked, they entertained him.Sometimes they pleased, sometimes they pained him,For as so lovingly they courted,Too freely with his locks they sported,That is, they dressed his hair.Each to her fancy trimmed his bust.The older lady for her sharePlucked from it the remaining black.Her buxom rival thought it then but justThe grey and white locks to attack:In fine, they dressed and plundered so,The head was bald and white as snow.He now found out their wicked pranks  "Ladies," he said, "ten thousand thanks.With head so bare I yet can boastThat I have rather gained than lost.For either bride, I see, would ruleMe, her poor sheep, her slave, her tool.All farther favours I refuse  From Hymen I have had no news.Bald heads, my queens, are not the go.I thank you for the lesson though."
