One that was just entring upon a long journey took up a fancy of putting a trick upon Mercury. He say'd him a short prayer for the bon voyage , with a promise that the god should go half with him in whatever he found.Somebody had lost a bag of dates and almonds, it seems, and it was his fortune to find it. He fell to work upon 'em immediately, and when he had eaten up the kernels, and all that was good of them himself, he laid the stones and the shells upon an altar. and desir'd Mercury to to take notice that he had permorm'd his vow."For," says he, "here are the outsides of the one ande the insides of the other, and there's the moiety (division) I promis'd ye."The MoralMen talk as if they believed in God, but they live as if they thought there were none. but their very prayers are mockeries, and their vows and promises are no more than words, of course, which they never intended to make good.
