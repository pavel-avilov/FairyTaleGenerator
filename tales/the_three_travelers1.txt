MasnaviA Muslim was traveling with two unbelievers, a Jew and a Christian, like wisdom linked with the flesh and the devil. God was "nigh unto his faithful servant," and when the first stage was completed he caused a present of sweetmeats to be laid before the travelers. As the Jew and the Christian had already eaten their evening meal when the sweetmeats arrived, they proposed to lay them aside till the morrow. but the Muslim, who was keeping fast, and therefore could not eat before nightfall, proposed to eat them that night. To this the other two refused to consent, alleging that the Muslim wanted to eat the whole of the sweetmeats himself.Then the Muslim proposed to divide them into three portions, so that each might eat his own portion when he pleased. but this also was objected to by the others, who quoted the proverb, "The divider is in hell."The Muslim explained to them that this proverb meant the man who divides his allegiance between God and lust. but they still refused to give way, and the Muslim therefore submitted, and lay down to sleep in the endurance of the pangs of hunger.Next morning, when they awoke, it was agreed between them that each should relate his dreams, and that the sweetmeats should be awarded to him whose dream was the best.The Jew said that he had dreamed that Moses had carried him to the top of Mount Sinai, and shown him marvelous visions of the glory of heaven and the angels.The Christian said he had dreamed that Jesus had carried him up to the fourth heaven and shown him all the glories of the heavens.Finally the Muslim said that the Prophet Muhammad had appeared to him in person, and after commending him for his piety in saying his prayers and keeping fast so strictly on the previous night, had commanded him to eat up those divinely provided sweetmeats as a reward, and he had accordingly done so.The Jew and the Christian were at first annoyed with him for thus stealing a march upon them. but on his pointing out that he had no option but to obey the Prophet's commands, they admitted that he had done right, and that his dream was the best, as he had been awake, while they were asleep.The moral is, that the divine treasure is revealed as an immediate intuition to those who seek it with prayer and humble obedience, and not to those who seek to infer and deduce its nature and quality from the lofty abstractions of philosophy.
