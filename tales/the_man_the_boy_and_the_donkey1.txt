A man and his son were once going with their donkey to market. As theywere walking along by his side a countryman passed them and said, "Youfools, what is a donkey for but to ride upon?" So the man put the boy onthe donkey, and they went on their way.But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said, "See that lazyyoungster, he lets his father walk while he rides."So the man orderedhis boy to get off, and got on himself.But they hadn't gone far when they passed two women, one of whom said tothe other, "Shame on that lazy lout to let his poor little son trudgealong."Well, the man didn't know what to do, but at last he took his boyup before him on the donkey.By this time they had come to the town, and the passersby began to jeerand point at them. The man stopped and asked what they were scoffing at.The men said, "Aren't you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poordonkey of yours   you and your hulking son?"The man and boy got off andtried to think what to do. They thought and they thought, until at lastthey cut down a pole, tied the donkey's feet to it, and raised the poleand the donkey to their shoulders. They went along amid the laughter ofall who met them until they came to a bridge, when the donkey, gettingone of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end ofthe pole. In the struggle the donkey fell over the bridge, and hisforefeet being tied together, he was drowned.Try to please everyone, and you will please no one.
