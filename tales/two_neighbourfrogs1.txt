There were two neighbour frogs. One of them liv'd in a pond, and the other in the highway hard by. The pond frog, finding the water begin to fail upon the road, would fain have gotten t'other frog over to her in the pool, where she might have been safe. but she was wonted to the place, she said, and would not remove.And what was the end on't now, but the wheel of a cart drove over her a while after, and crush'd her to pieces.The Moral:Some people are so listless and slothful that they'd rather lie still and die in a ditch, then stir one finger to help themselves out on't.
