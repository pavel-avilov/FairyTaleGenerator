Mr. Harrison said that he had heard many Nephite stories. He mentioned the one told by Mr. Claude Wright of Provo, Utah. According to Harrison, the story concerns some people who were driving on Highway 91 from Nephi to Cedar City. They picked up an elderly man who was hitchhiking. He rode in the back seat and conversed with them. Somewhere near Parowan they turned to speak with him but he had disappeared from the back seat of the car, which had not been stopped. They inquired about him a Parowan and were told that a person of the same description had previously appeared from nowhere and asked a lady for food and then had disappeared in open country when anyone might easily have been seen. It was thought by some that he was a Nephite.(Mr. Harrison lives in Provo. Filled a mission. According to Mr. Bryner, he was disfellowshipped from the L.D.S. Church. Very intelligent.)Oral version from notes.Helper, Utah, March 9, 1946.Informant: Mr. Harrison (Age, about 30).Collector: Hector Lee.
