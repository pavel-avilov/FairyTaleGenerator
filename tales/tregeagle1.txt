There is a popular story attached to this lake (Dozmary Pool), ridiculous enough as most of those tales are. It is, that a person of the name of Tregeagle, who had been a rich and powerful man but very wicked, guilty of murder and other heinous crimes, lived near this place. and that, after his death, his spirit haunted the neighbourhood, but was at length exorcised and laid to rest in Dozmary Pool. But having in his lifetime, in order to enjoy the good things of this world, disposed of his soul and body to the devil, his infernal majesty takes great pleasure in tormenting him, by imposing on him difficult tasks. such as spinning a rope of sand, dipping out the pool with a limpet shell, etc.
