Now, all the night around their echoing campWas heard continuous from the hills a sound as of the trampOf giant footsteps. but, so thick the white mist lay around,None saw the Walker, save the King. He, starting at the sound,Called to his foot his fierce red hound. athwart his shoulders castA shaggy mantle, grasped his spear, and through the moonlight passedAlone up dark Ben Boli's heights, towards which, above the woods,With sound as when at close of eve the noise of falling floodsIs borne to shepherd's ear remote on stilly upland lawn,The steps along the mountain side with hollow fall came on.Fast beat the hero's heart. and close down crouching by his kneeTrembled the hound, while, through the haze, huge as through mists atsea,The week long sleepless mariner descries some mountain cape,Wreck infamous, rise on his lee, appeared a monstrous Shape,Striding impatient, like a man much grieved, who walks alone,Considering of a cruel wrong. down from his shoulders thrownA mantle, skirted stiff with soil splashed from the miry ground,At every stride against his calves struck with as loud reboundAs makes the main sail of a ship brought up along the blast,When with the coil of all its ropes it beats the sounding mast.So, striding vast, the giant passed. the King held fast his breath Motionless, save his throbbing heart. and chill and still as deathStood listening while, a second time, the giant took the roundOf all the camp. but, when at length, for the third time, the soundCame up, and through the parting haze a third time huge and dimRose out the Shape, the valiant hound sprang forth and challenged him.And forth, disdaining that a dog should put him so to shame,Sprang Congal, and essayed to speak: "Dread Shadow, stand! ProclaimWhat wouldst thou that thou thus all night around my camp shouldst keepThy troublous vigil banishing the wholesome gift of sleepFrom all our eyes, who, though inured to dreadful sounds and sightsBy land and sea, have never yet, in all our perilous nights,Lain in the ward of such a guard."The Shape made answer none,But with stern wafture of its hand went angrier striding on,Shaking the earth with heavier steps. Then Congal on his trackSprang fearless."Answer me, thou churl!" he cried, "I bid thee back!"But while he spoke, the giant's cloak around his shoulders grewLike to a black bulged thunder cloud, and sudden, out there flewFrom all its angry swelling folds, with uproar unconfined,Direct against the King's pursuit, a mighty blast of wind.Loud flapped the mantle, tempest lined, while, fluttering down the gale,As leaves in autumn, man and hound were swept into the vale.And, heard o'er all the huge uproar, through startled DalarayThe giant went, with stamp and clash, departing south away.SIR SAMUEL FERGUSON.
