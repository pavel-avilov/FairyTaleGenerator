There was a trow called Broonie, who was supposed to be the king of Trowland. He showed himself very often. and it was remarked that if he had been seen in a corn yard all was sure to be right there, but if the visitant was an ordinary trow, mischief ensued.You may be sure folks were glad when Broonie paid them a visit, and they were careful not to go near any of the corn which he had been guarding, as it was observed that he objected to being overlooked, and resented such interference by laying the screws in herda (scattering the corn stacks).Broonie seemed to have taken a whole neighbourhood under his protection, and was seen gliding from yard to yard in the cold evenings, casting his spells upon the crop. The people felt sorry for Broonie, exposed to the chill night air, so they made a cloak and hood for him, and laid it in a yard which he frequented. Broonie took the well intentioned gi?t as an offence, for he was never seen again.
